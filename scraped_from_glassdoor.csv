You will be micromanaged and have your metrics displayed to the entire floor on a constant basis. Upper level management keeps morale extremely low because of their lack of transparency and crude comments to their employees.

-Out of each class, only a couple of people will actually stay. Even if your numbers improve, there is still a chance of getting fired.

- Obviously you should know you will be cold calling a lot. That being said a major con of this job is cold calling, don't underestimate how hard it is to cold call especially with training that is limited
- The only way to make any money at all is to get through a phase that is purely meant to weed people out, even if someone may have the skills to work with people and actually sell the product and help customers you still need to go through this mind numbing cold calling process
- Little to no description of product and it's benefits and features in the beginning. They only go through that with you once you get through the initial two months of cold calling. They explain this by saying they don't want you to be distracted by the product knowledge and explaining too much to restaurant owners, but in my case that just put me off a bit
- Burnout culture: ""You don't have to stay late, but..."", ""Take a lunch break if you need to, but..."" 
- Have to be extremely money motivated as this is not fun work in a ""fun"" work environment. Even so, don't expect to make much money at all until you have survived the phase best described as hunger games-esque
- Prepare to have your commission goals raised on you just as you are doing better

The whole sales process is built on a lie. The intro of every single cold call is ""hey this ____ with ConstantContact"" it is, in fact, true that SP is owned by Constant Contact but the product is an entirely separate entity. It is the equivalent of saying that you are calling on behalf of Facebook when you are in fact selling Instagram or WhatsApp. Therefore, a lie. The next line of the cold call is ""I manage the business listings in (insert territory) "" which is entirely untrue. SP reps dont manage anything, they sell software.  The following line is ""I was notified that (insert business) has inconsistent listings online"". Another lie.  There was no such notification. That business just appeared on the list of leads and that rep called them. 

If you are currently working at SP and are thinking that lying to people all day is ok because all sales organizations lie, then you're wrong. I changed roles and my manager never encourages me to lie. There's nothing to lie about. In fact, if I lied to a prospect I'd be fired. Take your sales experience from SP and use it to get a real sales job. 

If you are thinking about working at SP, don't.  Just get any other sales job. like ANY OTHER.

So here it goes.  

I am a current employee of SinglePlaform.  Before arriving here, I came from the grime of bohemia—spending my first two years out of college sleeping on couches instead of paying rent, performing in dingy spaces across the city, doing odd, crappy jobs—just suffering for the art, because “yolo” right?  

I came to SinglePlatform because I was desperate for stability and knew that sales were an analogous skillset to my theatre background (and frankly a sound alternative to performing in the bowls of New York City dungeons). 

I believe I was the antithesis of their employable prototype. I was a little older than the mean age of staff there. I had no business background whatsoever. I also had limited experience in sales…so it was a true leap for me.  I remember walking in there and seeing Greek lettering stapled to the wall, State School swag splashed across the desks in collegiate obeisance, the “Bro” species suited up with headsets and exploding with alpha-confidence.  The only thing I could think of was “O.M.G., how will I ever fit in here?!”     

However, in the ephemeral words of Elle Woods: first impressions aren’t everything. 

Needless to say, different as I was—the tortured artist with chips on her shoulder in six different places—I was welcomed to this company with open arms.  6 months into my employment, I can say with confidence, these people are some of the most supportive and lovely humans I have come across in a very long time.   Words cannot fully impart the tremendous gratitude I have for the people, reps and management alike.   I struggled so much the past few months (well years, but that’s a different story).  I went through several hospitalizations while at SP, some truly nasty personal drama, and more pertinently, I was (well, still am) rather mediocre at the job.   However, for all the tornados and tempests that I am, management stood by me the entire time, helping me both personally and professionally.  Every time a spattered into a puddle of stress and self-doubt, they’d take me to their office and ask me genuinely and kindly “how can I help you succeed?”   They ask this, not because they have to.  It’s because they want you to get better, be stronger.  They care just as much for helping small business as they do for their employees.  And I’m certain that this is true. The SinglePlatform Company, for all its ups and downs, is embedded with the human element.  They’re not a group of sterile people, not machines at a desk spitting numbers by rote all day long.  These guys are filled with both humor and grace. That alone, is worth coming to every morning at 9:00am and cold calling some SMBs.";"Before anyone applies, you should know, for most of you, THIS WILL BE A DIFFICULT JOB, because it’s SALES and that’s the name of the game.  You will get rejected 1000 times, told insane things on the phone, may even say insane things back (though I advise, keep yourself together and be CLASSY).   Some of you might want to quit after the first month, because let’s be real, cold calling is a hard knock lyfe.  Stick with it if you can.  I can assure you though, whether you want to go into sales as your career, or you have that entrepreneurial spirit, or whether you just want to boost you EQ* (emotion intelligence*, trust me, in any business venture, YOU NEED IT), Inside Sales at SP is a terrific foundation.  And you need to master the cold call. It’s essential for every business transaction you will make in your life. Trust it.  Trust the process.  Trust the management.  They’re fantastic.    

Also, the culture is exceptionally lax here.  Which is great for me, because I don’t think my rainbow personality could be confined in a pencil skirt and heels.  However, don’t let it deceive you. Be mindful.  I’ve learned the hard way because I’m a performer and grabbing attention to make people laugh is my strawberry jam. But it’s still an office.  Don’t be an idiot.  

One more thing.  If you are like me, juggling other ventures, or just have a very robust after work life, this job is not the easiest to juggle with.  It really requires you to be on and focused all the time.  I spend a lot of sleepless nights finishing up my projects and sometimes come into work tired and grumpy.  It can be done, I do it, but I don't recommend it. So unless you're a nut like me, try and just focus on the job.  It's the only way to get better.";;Helpful;Current Employee - Inside Sales Representative;;;;;Positive Outlook;Approves of CEO;Recommends

In fact, I do the stark opposite in my new position (in terms of business practices) than I would have at SP. This review is only a reflection of the sales floor, I cannot speak to any other facets of the business.

Just to start, I will say that a lot of the people here are very nice and many of the managers acfually care for their reps. In my own personal experience, I can confidently say that my manager definitely put his reps above everything else which was really what kept me going most days. I worked here for just under a year, and I was definitely a hardworking rep so the excuse of ""those giving poor reviews probably didn't work hard"" does not apply here. All I can say is that I completely wasted my time here and the only reason I stayed is mere complacency and fear that I wouldn't get a new job if I left. 

First and foremost, there is no sense of professionalism in the office. It's nice to have the option of wearing workout clothes to work, but the fact that there are basically no boundaries is more than a little offsetting. Now, I say there are no boundaries but that actually depends on where you fall in the social hierarchy that makes up this office. Basically, it's just like high school - if you're popular and a part of the ""in"" group, go ahead and do what you want because no one will care at all but if you aren't part of the ""in"" crowd you probably will feel disposable/unvalued (which every employee is creating a sense of zero job security), which doesn't encourage hard, quality work. I should also mention that ALL levels of management feed into this social hierarchy, admittedly some are worse than other,  but the feeling is ALWAYS there to the extent that some don't even acknowledge certain less popular employees.

In terms of professional growth, there is nothing here for you unless you're happy doing/learning absolutely nothing. They will basically give anyone the role of manager, regardless of how capable the person is of leading a group, the only requirement is to hit certain numbers. Obviously, that leads to people who have no business with the title ""manager"" leading a group of twenty-somethings who are willing to just go with it. Sure, you'll get a salary increase once you hit certain benchmarks but you absolutely won't be gaining any new skills here. Most people speak very highly of a Top Gun program they run where you get to work with different areas of the business, but you're only qualified after a year working and hitting 250 sales (not impossible but not really a walk in the park either, especially when so many leave in under a year).

Really what defines your success at SinglePlatform is your ability to buy into everything leadership feeds you. If you think differently, you'll end up at the bottom of the social food chain and will be treated very differently from someone who is happy to ""drink the kool aid."" Different viewpoints are not allowed here to the extent that there are underlying notes of sexism in a lot of your day-to-day. I have numerous personal anecdotes (ex: today you should sell on ""wives taking their kids to lunch on President's Day"" spoken by a manager). 

I really can go on about why SinglePlatform isn't a place for someone looking to grow and develop, but I think the above is sufficient. I will however add that if superficial recognition and material items fuel you, then this is definitely the place to work! They have a good soda machine and bring beer into the office every other week. They also are always running contests and have team nights out once a month where basically everyone gets drunk with their managers and then come into the office the next day (I never understood why they always wanted us to go out and get drunk and then come in hungover, still makes no sense).

Now I am one of those people giving advice. You have the opportunity to make as much money as you want. IF YOU ARE MONEY HUNGRY THIS JOB IS FOR YOU. They literally pay you to hit your goals and if you hit over your goals you are insanely well compensated. Monthly team night outs the company pays for you to eat and drink. Every month there is a Top 5 dinner that the 5 best reps in the company that had the highest % to goal get taken out to one of the fanciest restaurants in Manhattan.  You get swag every month you hit 100% of your monthly goal. Even crazy completions sending people to Cancun, Final Four March Madness, Miami, Atlantic City, Las Vegas. There is constantly a completion running for prizes money or free sales. Just to reward you for working hard and doing your job it's insane. You can tell by these reviews here for people who tried and didn't try at all, I am one who tried and has not stopped. Room to grow is insane, yes there is turnover. However you basically get a promotion almost every 4 months as long as you are hitting your numbers.

I've had my moments where I thought I was never going to get another sale or schedule a meeting and then 8 sales fall through. Sales is a roller coaster. Advice to anyone getting into sales if you can not handle rejections do not take this job. Do not take this job if you are not coachable you will not be able to grow.

You lie to restaurant owners on the phone and tell them they're being selected as a top restaurant for their town to have their menu featured on TripAdvisor and need to interview them for it so see if they'd ""be a good fit"". The next day you ""interview"" them and pitch them SinglePlatform. The product is great so people buy it sometimes.

No upward mobility since the mergers

The company has a very cheerleader/RA RA type culture that is almost cultish. Because being on the phone and doing this job is so awful, they need to have that pseudo-happiness going so people aren't miserable 100% of the time. Because of this, it's almost nauseating how far some of the more tenured employees have taken it - to the point where they actually believe they are a business analyst in NYC interviewing restaurants to pick as a top restaurant for TripAdvisor.

They monitor how many calls you make and your talk time (how long you spent on the phone). Which is fine, but their expectations for sales and numbers for effort metrics are generally inflated.

Extremely young management, so there's a lot of inexperience there.

Cut throat as far as firing you if you don't hit your goal. Performance Improvement Plans get brought out very easily.

Upper management are complete liars. They had us sign contracts stating that if goal for a month wasn't hit, you would get one more month under a new contract and if you didn't hit that goal, you would be terminated. They'll lie, say you never signed a contract and just terminate you under a new contract they force you to sign.

If you have prior sales experience you might be able to get a bit more, but if not you will be put on a $40,000 to $45,000 a year salary…which is outright nothing if you want to live in NYC. Then you will go through what they consider to be a ""first class"" training process which is nothing more than one of their 23 to 28 year old managers who have no real life experience teaching you how to lie over the phone. Once training has wrapped, you will then get on the phone and do nothing but call restaurants, yoga studios, and fitness centers ALL DAY trying to get them on board with the SinglePlatform product. The leads they provide the reps with are nothing short of garbage…so expect your commission checks to be limited.

In 2012-2013, SinglePlatform was purchased for $100M by Constant Contact which might have benefited some of the original members of SP…but for all the newcomers and anyone who plans on applying...you better understand that this place will be getting overly corporate very soon…especially since Constant Contact was just purchased by Endurance International at the tail end of 2015.

This place will tell you that ""you're family"" and that ""SinglePlatform supplies you with a carrier""…do not buy into anything they say to you because this is a sales job, and just like any other sales job you will be cut loose very quick if you don't meet goals. You're just a number in eyes of people who actually matter at this company.

If you sign anything with this company…make sure you get a copy or take a picture of all contracts because they have no problem lying to you or about you in the future.

Also, if you're looking for a place that offers solid opportunities for you later down the line…again this place is not for you…Once you become a closer after months of being a ""hunter"" or a ""full cycle rep"", you can then become a manager…and once you become a manager…your options dry up fast. I never spoke to a soul that was there for more than 5 years.

You may think I'm some bitter former employee who got fired because I couldn't hang…that could not be further from the truth. I went through the emotions for about 3 to 4 months and did very well during my time there…I just began seeing straight through the management and learned that this place really had nothing to offer my future aside from making bad money and continuously lying to small business owners.

Not to mention a lot of these kids do drugs in the bathrooms or on their breaks…I've also seen mice and roaches within the office on multiple occasions. 

So to wrap this up…don't waste you're precious time at SinglePlatform, they literally offer you nothing aside from 25 cent Clif Bars and free drinks.";;Helpful (6);Former Employee - Sales Representative;;;;;Neutral Outlook;No opinion of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

As in, management is so clueless, the majority of employees work significantly less than 40 hours a week without any repercussions.;"Former long time employee of MarkMonitor. I would like to preface this by saying things weren't always this way...

However, since MarkMonitor was acquired by private equity and rebranded as part of  Clarivate, things have gone downhill. Benefits were cut. Annual comp adjustments were lowered every year since the acquisition. Annual reviews make no difference in what your compensation will be the following year. Not even sure why they pretend to care about them. If you happen to exceed your annual goals and make a case for higher pay, don't expect management to action it for 9-12 months. 

In addition to the multiple rounds of layoffs from Clarivate, veteran employees have all but left as upper management could not be bothered to try and convince them to stay. The office has turned into a ghost town. They can't seem to fill any open positions because their compensation packages are so far below market value. They are aware of this but refuse to do anything about it. Employees should be willing to fit MarkMonitor's needs, not the other way around (more on this below).

Significant product launches have been delayed for years, resulting in unhappy clients and added stress to the services teams. Officious people leading initiatives everywhere creating more roadblocks than you can overcome. ELT is clueless and refuses to act on anything...unless it reduces the bottom line further. Employee morale is at an all-time low. Meanwhile, competitors in the market are agile, developing new products constantly; slowly but surely taking more and more market share. 

Honestly though, the worst part about MarkMonitor was the ELT's attitude of entitlement towards employees. If you ever get a raise, promotion, title change, ANYTHING...be prepared to have the company hold it over you for the rest of your career there. You can work hard, but at the end of the day, they will remind you that YOU owe THEM for the promotion they were gracious enough to give you.";;Helpful (12);Former Employee - Anonymous Employee;;;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

I wanted to add this to the original review, but I think GlassDoor only lets you add new reviews.  I left in the last year along with some of my peers.  Now that I've left, and with the acquisition, new management, and company up for sale, I thought it was a good time to add a review.  

This company is going to be around for a while and will continue to make good money.  They manage domains for the Top Fortune 500 companies and have a steady business there.  They've had trouble grabbing onto new growth trends, but their core business in Corporate Domain Management is solid.   

I think the new CEO has a lot of great ideas and enthusiasm.  He came in with a vision to upgrade the org and make it more corporate like a CA, Symantec or McAfee and to turn the company into a Big Data Company.  His achievements and clout with upper management at Thomson Reuters brought TR's legacy IP businesses under his org.";"I personally left because of the turnover in my area both above and below me.  I would have stayed on, but so much turnover in the org made it hard to get things done, and turnover at the top made it hard to set strategy or be recognized for my achievements.  The person who replaced me has already left too.  I'm still getting a lot of reach outs from people leaving the org.  The main reasons I hear are 

1) Thomson Reuters has announced it is selling the division (this is public info you can Google).  Traditionally new managers have come in, wiped things out, and brought in a new crew.  

2) That person is in one of the business lines that peaked out already and there's no growth.  

3) That person is in one of the areas where the boss or the team has a mean streak.  This is an edge case.  I saw some of the cranky reviews in Glassdoor.   They definitely don't define MarkMonitor, but unfortunately, some good people did have that experience.  There ARE some areas with a mean streak that go unchecked.  My advice to job candidates is as always, reach out on LinkedIn to people who have recently left the group you're interviewing with, and just don't go into a group where turnover seems to be an issue.  Let Management figure out what's going on there first.

There are plenty of young entry-level people here learning what it’s like to work for a big company that are totally happy, especially in Marketing and Sales.  A lot of the old Checkpoint clan watches out for each other and does pretty well.   I liked a lot of people here and didn't really have any problems with my co-workers.;"This place is terrible for engineers and technical people from the security, brand protection, and fraud industry.  The company makes an art of bringing people in, using their knowledge to train the existing team and spitting them out.  They have an auto-immune disease to smart people.  

Both the new and the old management team have always had a very top-down, ego-driven, superficial approach to managing people.  As a result, the company is way behind the times in terms of technology.  The tech stack is totally ancient, and we had to spend a lot of time doing crap work because management is so short-term focused that they can never see any business justification in upgrading it.   The company is two years behind on almost every major trend in the space.  Search, Social, Mobile, you name it.  The main focus of the company these days is on their domain business because that is what Thomson Reuters bought them for.  Almost every other business area is just being milked.  

The place is like stuck in 2008 from a recruiting perspective.  Think they can hire talented people, put them under less experienced people who can’t develop them and that nobody will care because everyone is so desperate for a job.  Inexperienced managers can’t coach or guide anyone on how to do their job, so every year at 360 review time they just ask people why nobody did enough for them lately and put people in a circular firing squad to blame each other.   

My experience was this.    It was one-way street for recruits in engineering.  The company hired me for a very special expertise.  Then they asked me to totally give my knowledge away so they could train younger, cheaper people from inside my manager’s posse.   I didn’t even get credit for half the work I did.    

I am not a whiner.  I sat down with my boss and spoke about my ambitions and how I wanted to learn more and advance my career.  I told him I was committed to the company but I wanted to be recognized for my contributions so I could have a career there, that I wanted to advance.  That’s when the mean streak kicked in.  Without notice, I was assigned to a totally different area outside my expertise.  My manager made his displeasure known to my team so I would get slammed at review time.  Without warning, after a year of solid work teaching my team how to do what I do, I got terminated.  It was humiliating.  

This is not going to be everybody's experience, but I’ve talked around now, and I know of at least maybe 10 other people in engineering and other technical roles who had similar experiences.  Some of them have gone on to do great things, which makes me think the company needs to do some thinking.  They seem to be really insecure about ambitious people.  Maybe it's because the industry isn't growing enough to reward them, so it's part of their HR strategy to work them out.  I don't know.

I went on to my next job, and it has been like any job I’ve ever had.  I work hard, people like my work, we share knowledge with each other, we advance the company, and we advance each other.";;Helpful (19);Former Employee - Anonymous;in San Francisco, CA;San Francisco, CA;;;;;Doesn't Recommend

There is apparent favoritism from management (those that have been there for 10+ years) this has created an environment where slackers and brown nosers are rewarded.  The pay is horrific for the amount of work that you are forced to do...slave labor...you are expected to work 45+ hours a week.  Even though you get a lot of vacation time, there is a double standard when you use it, you have to put up with a lot of snarky remarks from management.  Management states that they have an open door policy but if you dare to ask for assistance or imply that you have no bandwidth (and you are not a favorite) all of a sudden you get put on the black list and are told that you don't know how to manage your time and it goes all down hill from there. If you are unfortunate to work there keep your head down and do what you are told (be a yes man) and brown nose like your life depends on it...and you will be fine.

The agency however has left the aweful midtown area on 42nd and 3rd/Lex and moved into an edgy loft space in Soho. They've torn down the walls, got rid of all cubicles, and instilled a new spirit. Plus, there seems to be a great chemistry now between the employees. The pay is fair. Benefits are good. Just don't buy into their stock option plan. The stock's performance has been flat ever since, but that's due to the non-scalable business model of ad agencies.;"The agency finally realized it had to change, but change would take a minimum of 12 months to implement, and I simply couldn't wait that long. The office space on 42nd Street was aweful. It had the look and feel of typical American cubicle country. You'd sometimes walk in in the morning wondering if anyone was there. It looked and felt much more like a cost consultancy / accounting firm than a creative space. Furthermore, there was hardly any interaction between departments. Everyone acted and lived in their own silos. Many upper level managers came in, meant well, talked about change, but then soon hit the corporate wall resisting any kind of change. The killer came when SAP/R3 was implemented as business management software as imposed by the Interpublic Group. That definitely killed any kind of creative leftover spirit.

I am shocked at some of the more recent ratings as I have had a much different experience. 
My life has completely changed moving to the field “sales” role two years ago. Financially, I am doing very well but most importantly I have gained more skills professionally and grown outside of my comfort zone. I truly enjoy the team that I work with in the field and the teams that help support us. I have three great mentors, that not only make sure I have the tools to navigate a truly complex sale, but they always look out for me and my wellbeing. I do not feel micromanaged, not sure what those comments are about. It is disheartening to see former employees slander the executive sales team as they are the ones that pioneered the training and implemented sales processes from their success and built MDVIP into the largest player in this space. If you stay humble, listen to their advice and strategy, and relearn sales – you will succeed. I have been fortunate enough to spend a fair amount of time with the CEO and can honestly say he is the epitome of class, genuinely humble, and over all good person.

This position is sales based and requires drive and motivation to succeed.   While there has been many negative posts about management or Executive Directors(ED's) as MDVIP calls them, I can only share my experience with mine since I do not interact on a daily, weekly or monthly basis with other ED's.  My ED coaches, teaches and guides me through positive encouragement to succeed at the highest level.  My ED does push me and the team  (when you need to be pushed) but is also available any time day or night to help me through each new situation I come across (which were a lot when I first got started).  We have an unbelievable working relationship and I feel comfortable bringing any situation or problem to this person to help me solve it.  I know this might sound like paid advertisement, but it is not. I came from another industry (medical) with 15 years of high level sales experience (#1 in sales & growth in North America for my last two companies I have worked for) With all that being said, this is a very hard job. It requires a new perspective on sales that you do not get in many other sales jobs coming into this position. It requires very hard work, planning and a true personal motivation to succeed.  Like any other sales job you are required to hit certain bench marks in the first 3/6/12 months to succeed and keep your job (wow what a concept). If you are not out there calling on doctors, recruiting new prospects in creative ways, pushing yourself to learn everyday and yes taking personal time(nights and weekends) to go the extra mile you might not be very successful in this role.  Many phone call and interactions with doctors are in the evening  due to that fact that this is when they are free to talk and travel is an issue for some  (avg 2-3 day per week for me). This was all put forth during the interview process though and was agreed upon before the position was extended to me though.  I entertain and conduct webinars/conference calls  a good bit in the evening and am required to attend quarterly recruiting seminars we put on for new prospects. While this might sound like a fun time it is 100% work.  As anyone knows in sales, a nice dinner or weekend event  at a resort sounds fun, but once you attended a few you realize it is just work and not leisure. Overall, I work my tail off to be successful at MDVIP,  and if you are willing to go the extra mile, stay positive and take constructive criticism with a willingness to learn  you can make a pretty good career at MDVIP.  Being just here under a year I am excited for the next.;"Need more communication between outside departments.  I believe that success can be easier to achieve if information was shared more among all teams. Very little interaction with other regions and outside departments.  I was once told ""credit will find where credit is due"". In other words, don't worry about getting compensated directly for every little action.

I also love the autonomy that I have in running my own territory, the strategic nature of the job and the financial reward for success.;This is the best job I have ever had but also the most difficult.

I believe this is a direct result of the leadership team creating a process and a clearly defined path to success that is currently in place and taking the organization to unequivocal levels of growth.  How many organizations have you worked for that have experienced growth in each quarter for 17 straight years?!   None, I presume, because I haven’t either. This type of growth doesn't come without leadership, vision and FLEXIBILITY.  What you will find with our organization (on the recruitment side) is a team of seasoned professionals who have a track record of success in EVERYTHING they have done, historic milestones reached with MDVIP not withstanding.  Needless to say - the very driven, self starting, adaptable, type A individuals do incredibly well with this organization and are rewarded on a comparable level.  If you are a B minus student or a C student - this is NOT the place for you.  Hunter mentality-types thrive here.    
I should also mention that I've never worked for an organization where the goals of the physicians, the patients and our company are so closely aligned - this aspect is incredibly rewarding.  Clearly, every job has its challenges but, this has by far been the biggest challenge in my professional career.  This required me to abandon my 'proven' methods and adopt something different and something that is initially, uncomfortable.  NEWSFLASH:  this is the formula which leads directly to professional and personal growth!!  Some people aka: the nay-sayers don't get that - so I have to make it a point.  
On a lighter note – this has also been an incredibly FUN and rewarding place to work.  Company sponsored events, the NSM's, working with incredible physicians, the MDVIP team, and the work travel have allowed me to visit places in our country that might have otherwise been ‘bucket list’ locations.  These experiences just can’t be bought or learned in a classroom.  The ""fun"" part of the company culture  counter-balances the difficulties and tribulations you experience during the daily grind and make MDVIP a truly unique, desirable, and FUN place to be employed.      
After reading some of these negative posts, as you probably have already surmised, there are too many entitled people around that feel they are ‘owed’ or aren't willing to change or just don't have the work ethic to be successful anywhere – let alone with MDVIP.  Hope this helps.";"First 6 months are TOUGH - but, if you follow the proven model - you will find success.

The benefits are extremely expensive also and they will enroll you in them even if you choose to opt out and it takes a long time to unroll in them.;Oh my... Where do I start? The management is pisspoor. You can't ever get in contact with them, they always tell you that you're wrong, and will talk about you in front of your coworkers and behind your back. They will also lie about the time that you work. For example, if you clock in at 7:57 and your normal start time is 8:00, they will just round that up to the nearest hour instead of paying you for those 3 minutes that you actually work. But if you're just a few minutes late clocking back in for lunch (like for example the same amount of time you got to work early), that's counted against you and you get pointed. It's an extremely unfair company and I'm pretty sure I'm about to file a lawsuit against them for the lost wages from them lying about time worked.

In my experience, they literally went beyond their job descriptions just to make sure I'm on the right track to getting my foot in the door for any opportunity that opens up the window for the choice of my career. I suggest, however, having your availability open as well as your work choice open. Only because, depending on the job you truly want, it may not be available for a while. Openly and freely speak to your recruiter about your goals, what you plan on learning and gaining from Staffmark opportunities for personal growth. They generally love to help you meet your standards from what I gathered with them. 

The companies that they are tied with are also some really great people to work with and work for. Sometimes I found amazing opportunities through managers at the assignment I was put on who no doubt have an open door policy. Even as a temp or new hire. If you don't like the assignment you are put on, most likely the managers there can help. But, they don't want you to just give up. It's a two way street. They want you to try to help yourself in order for them to help you. They push you so that you aren't that employee that jumps from opportunity to opportunity just because it is given. Staffmark recruiters as well as Managers of the companies that they are partnered with are all so helpful and as uncommon as it may seem, attentive to the man or woman that you want to be in the workforce. They not only find you work quickly, but also work that suits you well after getting to know you and continually learning you as an employee. Staffmark for Auburn, WA - Yeah, they're pretty legit.";"Some of the recruiters in HR are not always there to answer your calls. And sometimes it'll feel like they are rarely in their office when you try to reach them. Which is how I learned about turning to the managers at the assignment assigned to.
 Also, as someone who contacts employers, leads or trainers via email, it doesn't help that they sometimes send out emails and group emails but can never get back to your emailed response. I'm not sure if their emails sent out are automated or if they just pass your emails but, that could possibly change maybe. I mean,  if you're going to send one out, why not pay attention to what's being sent in. You know?

I have personally never had this problem, but a few people I have worked with had problems with their check. Either it being late or shorted. I haven't had an issue with this for as long as I have worked for Staffmark, but, for you, just follow your hours. Track them and make sure it's correct come payday.

The insurance is unremarkable and just about more trouble than it's worth... it'll save you from losing everything to the hospital if you have an emergency, but at these pay scales you'll never have anything more than a 2-bedroom apartment and a barely functioning car. On the matter of catastrophes, there are no ""sick days"" -- you get a few unconditionally excused ""events"" a year which cause you to lose pay if you have to make use of them. Following that, you're out -- no appeals, no transfers. You join on ""probation"" which means you have a few ""free"" months in which to learn the ropes.

The client companies for whom the work is actually done (all Staffmark employees are temp-to-hire) are always on the lookout for smooth talkers and fast typers and these are the people who get the max bonuses and promotions. Everybody else gets canned after six months or so. The performance metrics are divided into two parts: productivity (measured in call handling time), and quality (customer handling). If your quality is bad, you're out early; if your productivity is below the target , even if you're at average for the center - they'd sooner purge their entire workforce than give people who manage 65 wpm regular raises. And they do, very often, making the job really tough from the get-go because callers are always irritable from being on the phone for a while. But let's face it: you're not taking this job because you want it... you're desperate because companies want cheap labor and they can bribe congress to force you to do it.

Ok kids listen up. These jobs are low pay, low skill, and sometimes temp to hire. They could care less about you as a person or your financial needs, that's life. These employees a Staffmark are just happy to land a job their selves and some work two jobs because their wage is so low. They will lie to you, they will side with a company regardless of how dirty you were treated and they will look over you knowing you have more than the qualifying skill for the job. keeping their clients is a priority and you don't matter at all.

My best advice.... Get out there and get you some kind of an education. Preferably a skill trade because the money is in trade. Join a good local and become a union member. Your union will fight for a better wage for you and will not allow you to be treated like these factories treat you that staffmark sends you to. Listen, anyone can work for staffmark and many of these supervisors have less education than you do. They are not interested in your future because they are struggling themselves. So, If you want more of the same keep doing what your doing. If not, then make some changes. Rant over";;Helpful (4);Former Employee - Anonymous Employee;;;;;;;

Technological improvements have helped streamline operations to help lighten the load of recruiters and operations personnel.   Clients love the Staffmark firm do to our ability to satisfy their personnel requests.;"- Very little pay for the managers and recruiters.
- Staffmark does not provide enough staff per office.  Employees feel overwhelmed and underappreciated
- Expectations are extremely high with little reward.  For example, you can bring in multiple new accounts and revenue as a recruiter and fill temp to perm requisitions, but are NEVER be compensated for these efforts.  The commission structure is not as competitive with other agencies.
- Incentives are laughable.  If you win a contest, mere $5 gift cards serve as a reward.
-Morale is low because everyone is so overworked.  Upper management does not care about work/life balance.  When away from the office, (vacation, medical leave, sick day, me time) you will receive calls from management that can wait upon return to the office.
-Some individuals within upper management make poor decisions, but are quick to shift blame to others when that poor decision affects revenue growth and/or operations.

Over the course of 2 years I watched around half of the staff leave the Atlanta office. Management never supplemented these major losses with new talent to fill in the gaps left behind. At first, one would think this is a great opportunity to promote from within and increase compensation for all remaining employees but that didn't happen either.  So what you were left with was an understaffed office that overworked the remaining employees while not earning higher salaries. It was clear that local management was aware of the need for staff but they always countered with excuses such as ""we don't have the budget for more staff right now,"" ""we found someone but their compensation demands were too high and we couldn't come to an agreement"" and sometimes just ""it's really hard to find someone right now.""";;Helpful (4);Former Employee - Engineer;in Atlanta, GA;Atlanta, GA;;;Neutral Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

The people create a welcoming atmosphere and have launched a few initiatives towards employee wellness and community—currently, we have a group growing herbs and vegetables in the break room to later disseminate to workers on site, we have a Wellness Wednesday where wellness tips are emailed company-wide and fresh fruit is provided in the break room, and we also have periodic events geared towards career-building and just plain having fun with your coworkers (like the occasional silly competitions and air hockey tournament).

As far as the work culture, people in IT are respectful, professional, warm, and funny. Also, there's something to be said about the colorful diversity of our group and how well we all get along. As far as worker satisfaction, I can only attest to my personal experience, but I know I've seen myself and others be recognized and praised by management for a job well done. I feel immensely supported and driven to succeed and greatly enjoy working and interacting with people on this team on a daily basis. This has been a wonderful place to learn and grow, everyone is extremely helpful. They say you should work at a job which makes you happy, and I believe I have found that here. On a board in the hallway, we have a display of names of employees who have worked at TMS for 5, 10, and even 20 years! It's a well-populated list. Employee retention at this rate is so rare these days, and these people's track records can only be evident that TMS must be doing something right.";TMS has recently gone private, and there are some shifts occuring in the company. Unfortunately, there is a salary freeze in place for the next year or so until things stabilize.;;;Current Employee - Applications Developer;;;;;;;

Management is always walking around the call floor so if you are unsure of how to handle a call its easy to find help.;If a customer isn't calling to make a payment or set up a plan they are usually disgruntled. If you have a temper this is not the job for you, a lot of callers will be rude. There is not much down time between making calls.

Permanent employees in the call center have not gotten raises in over 5 years and are not valued. There is no career path or opportunity to move up unless there is an opening in another department and management in the call center will convince the other department not to hire you because they need people. The software is a joke as well as the IT department. The system is down several times a week which causes angry customers. The customers are very rude and their word is always taken over the representative. Management is the biggest problem. They pick on certain people, usually those who have gone on medical or stress leave and make it unbearable for them to come back to work in a calm environment.

I recommend this place to friends who need to pay the bills, but always tell them how poorly run the place is upfront.";"TMS hires exclusively through temp agencies, then will let you work as a temp for 2-3 years before they hire you full time. Temps make more money than permanent workers “because they don’t get any paid time off.” However, when they are hired permanently (if they can last that long) they are given a raise and thus are paid even more than permanent workers. 
The longer you are there, the more aspects of the operation you are trained on. You have no option to decline. They want you to think they are doing you a service by offering these trainings to you even though you do more work and are paid less than a temp.
There is a specific set of criteria for each type of call you are trained to take. You’re supposed to remember everything on every type of call. You’ll get multiple classifications of calls throughout the day without warning. If you don’t use the customer’s name, you’ll get points off. If you say “social” instead of “social security number” you’ll get points off. If your call score isn’t “up to par” someone literally sits with you and reads a sheet of paper word for word of what they typed out for your call review. I find that strange, since TMS is apparently using a BA as a qualification for hire now. You’d think everyone knows how to read if they’re college graduates. 
You’re made to uselessly fold the flap of an envelope to the inside. Seriously. I’ve seen someone fired because they asked to go home early instead of fold these stupid things.
There was once a bonus program where you’d get $1 for every fee you’d collect. However when you were paid out your bonus (at random) the amount before taxes would be something like $203.76. How?! Nobody was ever able to explain that one. We were also told we had to track our own late fees collected by filling out a form after every call because we might not meet the quota. What quota? That was never explained or talked about ever again. If you take too long filling out these forms, someone would come over and ask you what you were doing. Obviously, they’d be interrupting you and take up more time so how were you supposed to get done in less than 1 minute after a call?
Managers are terrible. They stand around and talk about food all day then walk around and try to catch people on their phones once in a while. The career reps acted as spies. They played favorites.

Some of the middle and upper management leaders don't listen to the frontline....there's too much red tape to cut through when trying to enact positive change. Sure, there's a lot regulations a company in this industry must work through, but the culture of the company is resistant to change. It takes months to get a simple IT request through the queue...even one that could save the company millions in time and money. Part of this problem is that one of the lead IT guys is the original owner's son and lacks the necessary training for such a position. The company as a whole suffers from nepotism, but I believe that many of the people that should have been let go long ago have been laid off since my choosing to leave the company (despite being asked to stay).

This reduction in head count was not due to the company struggling necessarily. Rather, the executives bonuses are based on EBIT goals and with the year end fast approaching, the lay offs occurred to reduce expenses and ensure that the EBIT margin was met.

This event captures pretty much my entire experience with Wencor. The focus of the executive leadership and most managers is solely on themselves.

I was lucky enough to get forced out as a result of the move to Georgia, but everything I hear and have experienced is a disaster at this company.

The only commonality between employees that could potentially be deemed a ""culture"" is that everyone hates coming to work. When this company was family owned it was a pretty good place to work. It was not perfect, but the owners cared about their employees. Now all that matters is numbers...and it is really difficult to get any enjoyment out of your work.

The private equity ownership and CEO have reduced staff and resources so much that the company is merely a shell of what it used to be. And the current structure is not lean in the sense of being efficient, it is lean in that there is hardly anything left to work with. Most of the experienced employees who possessed a tremendous amount of knowhow have either left on their own, or as a result of their jobs being moved to Georgia. 

Management below the executive level is incapable of taking any action. Most remaining managers, directors, etc. have been burdened with the responsibility of 3-4 positions. When a position is eliminated or that individual leaves, the company just moves the responsibilities over to an existing manager.  This works well for the V.P. and executive level positions. When numbers are not being hit, the managers are then made the scapegoat for not performing, even thought they are doing 3-4 times more than what they were originally hired to do! This only trickles down throughout the company, there are really no relationships between managers and employees. Everyone is just stuck and afraid to act because they anticipate being included in the next lay off.";;Helpful (2);Former Employee - Anonymous Employee;in Springville, UT;Springville, UT;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

Seriously.  A soda machine.)";"Absolutely awful leadership.  Warburg Pincus owns the Wencor Group and purchased them from Odyssey a few years back.  Warburg has a reputation for taking companies public- which has been influencing a lot of company decisions in terms of office headquarter re-location and re-branding Wencor Group's business segment strategy.  Ownership is falling on their faces though.  Moody's has already changed Wencor rating to 'negative' based on how highly-debt leveraged Wencor is and are under-performing.  Google it.  The CEO has shifted the headquarters from Springville, UT to Peachtree City, GA citing the ability to recruit greater talent to the greater Atlanta area rather than Utah.  The change has cost the company tens of millions of dollars and to be honest the Peachtree City office is just weird.  There are zero pull factors out there and there is not that much talent there.  I don't think very many Georgia Tech grads are too stoked to graduate and work for Wencor.

In terms of salaries, they are extremely inconsistent, generally not competitive with the market and still carry an attitude of ""you should be grateful you have a job.  If you don't like what we're paying you, there's the door...""  

They do an atrocious job at retaining and developing talent.   The majority of all the stellar engineers leave after a year or two as there is zero room for growth and they are not competitive in terms of salaries.   Metrology and engineering are the best departments to work in.  Any other team/department is extremely sterile and unexcited.  Don't get on board unless you are really needing a paycheck or are just looking for something short term (1-2 years). 

Unless you are a VP or a director, nobody really looks out for you and tries to develop/invest in you as an employee.  They are typically proponents of cutting cuts and keep wages down yet they are the first one's to ask for raises from their superiors and title changes, etc.  In a lot of ways, you kind of just feel like a pawn (chess piece).  Product Development, technical purchasing, and engineering leadership are good people.   Any other boss I would not be excited to work for.

The systems and databases are super archaic.  They just recently got Salesforce.  There is zero synergy of systems or amongst sister companies.  Wencor Group owns 9 sister companies but everything just feels bolted on and un-unified.

I'd only recommend working in metrology (as an intern) or engineering (if you want a cushy, non-innovative project engineering role).";;Helpful (3);;in Springville, UT;Springville, UT;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

They have tunnel vision and mom and pop sized business mentality or thinking in a large corporation.

Amerigroup leaders has also discriminated against military Veterans, tenured employees with disabilities, pregnant women, non-degreed tenured employees and elderly women.

No support from Human Resources: Although they have an HR Department and more than enough HR Specialists; instead, they utilize a third party department of inexperienced college students to resolve ongoing and new internal issues and even legal issues. This department known as ARRT is really there to protect the company and does not support employees.

Houston Texas Provider Relations Dept is managed by leaders unfamiliar with the territory or account management therefore, has a small-town mentality and unfamiliarity when it comes to managing expanded territories such as Greater Houston/Beaumont which has caused an ongoing high-turnover in the Provider Relations Dept. This Department has a revolving door. 

Management's priorities and goals when it comes to employees are dull, asinine, juvenile and does not help the company or employees grow.  They will do whatever it takes to make themselves look good.

Almost every department at this office is under a ""Corrective Action Plan"" which aims to correct issues.

It is true that they rely on an offsite ""team"" in Virginia Beach, VA who's resources are stretched thin and who don't fully understand the KS market, yet they continue to try to introduce more and more programs to appease the State.

The dog and pony show that is put on when the State visits the office for audits or readiness reviews is beyond ridiculous.  

There is a high turnover rate at this office - people are quitting (or being terminated) left and right.
Kansas is an ""at will"" State, so AGP can and will fire you FOR NO REASON and still be justified.

Raise.  What raise?  This company lost big money during their first year of operation so don't look forward to a decent raise, no matter how well a performer you are.

AGP values their employees so much, they have a committee that puts on events to raise money so employees can have fun activities.  For the Holiday Celebration 2013, lunch was catered by Cinzetti's, but they sill asked employees to bring a dish.  SO TACKY.

My manager had no idea how to do my job.  I was also told not to ask anyone for help when she couldn't answer my questions.

This is a professional environment with exempt employees.  However, employees are treated like first graders and are instructed to not have personal conversations.  That is virtually impossible when you sit across from someone in a cubicle.

Any employee can spend 2-4 hours per day on phone meetings but will not be issued a headset or be allowed to use the speakerphone.  That is physically painful.

Ergonomics is non-existent, and this is a healthcare company!

When an offer is made, you are told you will spend the first week training.  That is not true.

They have some nice online courses you can take, but they must be taken on your own time after work.  No laptop is provided, so if you want to learn you have to try to figure out how to work late in an unsafe area alone.

The job description does not match the job you are asked to do.

Managers yell loudly at employees when things don't go their way.  Nobody is perfect.  And by the way, if managers would read their email they might find out things they wouldn't have to yell about.

Email is a good way to communicate and follow up on meetings.  It is also a good backup (CYA) for due dates, duties, etc.  My manager said not to send her emails like that.

There was no backup for this position, so while it's ice to have 4 weeks vacation in a year it's impossible to get those days off.

While the company enjoys a casual environment, make no mistake that people there are driven to give it their all to constantly get better, innovate and evolve to continue leading the pack.  So anything less than being the best you can be at your job is not acceptable.  Given that, in a start-up, you can't expect to be rewarded with promotions and upward movement at a rate which you might expect from a large corporation. The bottom line is that the company operates efficiently to accomplish as much as possible with what makes sense from a business and financial perspective and that doesn't necessarily mean spending money to add employee bloat so that others might have the opportunity to move up into a management position.;;Helpful;Current Employee -;;;;;;;Recommends

It is also very hard to get promoted past a certain level. The study directors tend to be managers, supervisors, and external Ph.D. hires the stars have to align in order for a technician to become a supervisor. Usually a supervisor has to quit and then you have to brown nose to get into that position. The turnover at the technician level is fairly high and each department is judged on QA metric, so when staff is lost the metrics take a hit and the managers/report writers end up taking the blame. 

The technicians in certain departments end up doing a lot of the study directors and lab manager's work, because they are in meeting constantly. Its a little unfair to push all of these responsibilities on the techs. A technician should not, in many cases, be solely responsible for QA event investigations.

This company is crazy about quality which is good, but it makes technicians feel as though they are working under a microscope. It is also unfortunate that so much of a technician's promotion potential is dependent on their right first time (RFT) and the amount of repeats that they have. So many times a study director will blame the technician for anomalous results when they have no other explanation.

Can get some lab experience for CV";The glasgow site virology is the most horrendous place to work. It has an extremely bad impact on both your physical and mental health. The stress levels of lab staff are through the roof due to them being given a work load that is far from manageable or achievable to get through. Most people have to go without breaks just to try and get finished at a relatively decent time. Or if you are really lucky maybe you will get 20 mins and a chance to go to the toilet. On top of this the amount of overtime necessary is ridiculous. To top it off it this overtime is often not optional but rather expected.  It is not a hidden fact that there is bullying from the middle management and certain supervisors. Trying to get holidays off were a nightmare and often refused. There was a rather large finger pointing culture wherby any issues that occured were automatically blamed on the lab staff. When trying to highlight any issues it seemed that management were not in the slight bit intrested but instead would get there back up and do their best to shut down the opinions of the staff.  The expectations of the management and supervisors are never going to be met as they didn’t actually seem to realise the time or effort most tasks actually took.  The overturn of staff is unbelievable with very few actually managing to make it past a couple of years, when I left nearly all members of the lab were actively seeking new roles and that included the newer members who hadn’t even been there for 6 months.  Wages are also below what other companies are offering for similar posts. This along with my mental sanity was the biggest reason for me leaving.

Secondly, they have been acquired by Merck. So things have the potential to improve, but unless you here from other reviewers (after June 2017) that there has been an overhaul of middle managers, don't get your hopes up.";"I worked for BioReliance for approx. 2.5 years, I started my career as an Associate Scientist and left the company as an Associate Scientist II.
Over the 2.5 year span I participated in several of cross-functional teams in all three sites of BioReliance, this gave me the opportunity to work closely with many of the Operations directors, managers and team members, so before I delve into the problems at BioReliance, I’d like to clarify that this review refers ONLY to the Glasgow site. From my experience, the Pentlands and Stirling sites were well managed and appeared much more positive than the Glasgow site.
I’ve broken the issues down to several areas which I believe need addressed at BioReliance Glasgow.

SALARY – Simply put the salaries at BioReliance are not competitive and the increases are not good. I left the company for a similar role in another company for a 45% salary increase.

CULTURE – BioReliance Glasgow operates with a blame culture, as with any company (particularly one with such a high turnover), mistakes happen. However, at BioReliance the first priority is to blame the most junior member of staff and often to publicly shame this person. 

HOLIDAYS – The situation surrounding holidays for lab staff in BioReliance is absurd. I have had holiday requests declined months in advance because “we might be busy”. Several of my colleagues were declined holidays because team members in completely different functional groups also had a holiday booked that day. Supervisors and management take holidays at any given time, but lab staff are expected to work overtime and have their own holidays dictated by the convenience of the company.

TRAINING – There are no training plans at BioReliance. You are trained very quickly in one assay (because the previous person has left) and you are expected to perform that assay every day for years. Until, that is, you threaten to leave. At which point they will train you in a second assay…this pattern continues.
You are not trained for your personal development, you are not trained due to interest.

PROGRESSION – The issue with the progression at BioReliance is not that is does not exist, but the extreme lengths needed to gain promotion. Managers continually impress that you are “close to promotion” or “being considered” but this is not the case. 
After 18 months at the company I had worked to ensure that I ‘ticked off’ every aspect of the senior associate scientist job description. Despite this, I was not given the promotion and tld I “just missed”, I was encouraged to work harder.
After 2 years at the company I was the most highly qualified, most accomplished and most trained member of lab staff within my team. I was declined the promotion a final time, given the reason that I was not emotionally mature enough. 
My experience is not uncommon, many of my ex-colleagues have left for the same reason. Lab staff are pitted against each other to compete for promotions which do not exist, it creates an incredibly negative environment and drives a wedge of hostility among teams.

WORKLOAD – Workload is poorly managed, with some members of staff doing 4 times the work of others. Skipping lunch and working late is commonplace. Stress related absence is rife throughout the lower tiers of staff.
SUPERVISORS – Put simply (most) supervisors are unsuited for their positions. In some cases supervisors are less qualified or accomplished that the scientists they supervise, but have progressed to that position through years spent at the company (which includes years spent on maternity leave). In my experience, supervisors were indecisive, undiplomatic and lazy. During my time at BioReliance I worked alongside one very good supervisor, but he has since left the company.

MANAGEMENT – There is huge variety within the management at BioReliance. The UK site head (at the time I left) was very capable, with very good aims for the company. However, all attempts to change from this negative spiral in the Glasgow site die at the middle management level. 
Initiatives are in place. Huge amounts of resource are invested into improving things, but these are all blocked at the middle management level, particularly in the Molecular Biology, Virology and Microbiology departments.";;Helpful (11);Former Employee - Associate Scientist II;;;;;Neutral Outlook;No opinion of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

You can get working experience in the biotech industry.";"Workload- Initially you will wait to be trained in something worthwhile for a minimum of 6 weeks. Immediately following limited, irregular and poorly organised training, you will be expected to take on a full workload in the lab. This is in addition to lab housekeeping, project work and using or updating outdated and barely usable protocols/documents.New starts become demotivated, in some cases waiting more than 3 months to be trained in what they were employed to do in the first place. Blame culture in the company is rife leaving everyone to adopt a ""look out for number one"" attitude. 

Senior management try to employ schemes and plans that could make a difference. However, this is never monitored at ground level to see if it is being employed successfully. The message gets lost or more likely ignored at middle management who continuously push deadlines for tasks on to their department. This then becomes your job-  continuously trying to complete massive tasks or projects in a very limited time frame with little to no help to achieve your goals.

Career Development- Not much to say here, in my time at the company I was never shown anything to do with career progression despite senior management saying it was a""key area"". The exception to this rule would be the customary ""you've been here a year"" promotion and salary increase to something you probably expected to get when you joined. After this promotion, look forward to supervisors giving you their whims and errands as they can't be bothered to actually go down to the labs and engage situations directly.

Pay- ""equipment under £10k is peanuts"" yet a fair salary must be akin to a diamond as these are rare and extremely hard to come by.

Management- My department was ran by a somewhat autocratic manager with a limited grasp on both where the labs are physically located in the building as well as what actually goes on there. Supervisors are either never in work to begin with or too indecisive to do anything. 

Decisions which affect the lab are regularly made by people who do not have an idea of processes there or how it will affect the people that work there daily. For them, this ticks a box on a spreadsheet thus ""mission accomplished"".

If you are not part of the original clique you are bullied, you are picked on, you are harrassed, you are undermined, you are blamed and you are pushed out.  

High staff turnover (typical employee lasts between three and twelve months) ensures inexperienced staff are training new staff.  Training is one of two events; employees are shown once and signed off or  are told just read the SOP - you signed it therefore you agreed you understood it.  

Lab managers pass the blame for their ineptitude onto lab workers going as far as to blame untrained and unsupervised new starts for serious incidents.  Pregnant workers have been bullied to go into labs with known carcinogenic chemicals against precedent and when they refuse they are threatened with disciplinaries.

Overtime is constant and happens on a daily basis due to overload; people regularly stay until nine and ten at night and they DO NOT GET PAID as their efforts are unauthorised.  Authorised means it is pre-arranged weekend overtime.  
  
There are no committments to employee improvement (apart from work harder and be more productive for our shareholders) so there is no proper training, no proper recognition of talent, no mentoring.

- Somewhat flexible work environment. So long as you do quality work and meet your deadlines, no one cares if you come in at 8 or 9, or take the occasional long lunch. 
- Reasonable work/life balance. Workload is such that my day ends when I leave the office. At rare points throughout the year, you might be expected to work longer, but you can usually make up for it after the chaos dies down . 
- Not a terribly stressful job, day-to-day. If you’re relatively intelligent and well-organized, the work is very low stress.";"- Massively underpaid. By staying with this company for more than 1-2 years, you will drastically reduce your earning potential. Salary increases are minimal and barely keep pace with inflation. Management acknowledged that low pay is the biggest issue for employees and has developed a multi-year plan to address this (but only for the highest performers that are found by the company to be paid at below market rates). Unfortunately, employees don't have years to wait for the possibility of a slight salary bump. You’re better off leaving for a company that will rightly pay your worth from the get-go. Case in point: I left for a 80% salary increase. Not even an upward movement. Similar work. Same title. That’s how lowly I was paid at DRG. 
- Work can become boring over time. DRG is a great place to gain exposure to the healthcare industry. But there is little emphasis on personal growth or continuing education or training. Doing the same work day in and day out will not advance your skill set. And while there’s a lot of talent, it’s not being leveraged fully. And oor pay, meager raises/bonuses, don’t inspire people to go above and beyond. 
- Unambitious employees. The work environment is friendly and low-stress. And the work has the potential to be interesting. But at the end of the day, friendly coworkers don’t pay the bills.

2. The main philosophy of this organization is: hire young, pay them minimally, work them to death, and show them the door if anyone doesn't like it. Morale of the workforce is very low.  They demand loyalty, yet show none.
3. The employee evaluation process is useless. Rankings, raises, and bonuses really have nothing to do with performance.

- Good work environment; my coworkers and the individuals from other workgroups that I collaborated with tended to be friendly and, with rare exception, good at collaborating openly, exchanging suggestions without anyone getting offended, etc.  There are a lot of people at the company with academic research backgrounds and I think that contributes to the more collegial atmosphere.  

- The pay and benefits were fair, with a good amount of paid time off.

- Good work/life balance.  I was rarely asked to work overtime and our schedule was flexible enough that in the event that we needed to do extra work to finish a project on time, I felt completely willing to do so.";"- When I was at the company, upper management was pretty out of touch with both the average employees and with middle management.  While we were worrying about getting laid off and training our replacements, upper management was sending out overly peppy emails about company spirit.  I know that since I left they replaced the old CEO and purged some of the other execs, so this may have changed, but a year ago this was a serious issue.

The difference then is that we had a broad vision and strategy, which made it exciting and clear as to why we were changing.

It's no secret that the company is going for quantity over quality, hiring hundreds of positions in India so they can replace higher paid people in other locations to cut cost and make their books look better.

Weeks of hard work can be ruined by atrociously poor formatting and layout at the production stage. Your data and analysis can be very good, but your report can look so ugly and unreadable. Clients don't want to look at trash.

And the decision to split the company into solutions and operations is terrible. The solutions team is a joke. They insist on their own ideas and ignore the issues flagged by the people who are actually executing on the project. Then they launch the product prematurely in order to meet a deadline, and they also don't train the sales team on how to sell it. And when it doesn't sell, they fire people in operations. Then solutions team get promotions for cutting cost.

To be honest it is unfair to criticize our CEO as the upper management team is constantly changing. Every month we'd have a different chief officers leaving and being replaced by someone with no experience whatsoever. Oh by the way we have 3 CEOs in 5 years too.

We used to have a great team of talented, hardworking individuals who served the company for decades. Now they all left the companies for obvious reasons. 

Some particular members of the management team never got punished for their mistakes; only working level analysts are let go on a constant basis. Many analysts and managers were fired in the past 9 months and we were never allowed to hire replacements outside India. We shut down over 5 functions and departments, and re-established them in the Indian office.

A lot of useless softwares and processes were introduced just to frustrate employees. Upper management use this ""innovation"" to justify their existence. What they never know is that these procedures only add burden to DRG employees.

Senior management is deaf and inept, lacking vision while brimming with misplaced confidence. The corporate culture is toxic as it festers among the beige cubicles.

In many ways, it's very sad to see Epocrates in such a state because there was a time when it was a very innovative company, a true pioneer in mobile healthcare. For years, Epocrates had no competition, which is bad because it stifles the killer instinct a technology company needs in order to innovate. They were successful despite themselves. Eventually, competition came knocking and Epocrates was not able to respond. 

Fortunately, Epocrates had amassed a large database of US physician email addresses which proved to be just valuable enough for AthenaHealth to acquire them. Maybe Athena can turn the company around, but it will be a long slog as they try to figure it all out.  

If you're into a job where you can disappear inside their process while sucking off the corporate teet, then have at it. You can actually work there for a long time, producing almost nothing.

- Brand recognition within the industry
- Work/life balance
- Vacation policy -- Policy was changed early 2011 essentially eliminating ""formal"" vacation hours (ie = take it as you want)
- Decent health benefits / gym reimbursement";"As my headline indicates, Epocrates has succeeded in spite of itself the past 2 years.  The strength of the brand and the core product itself seem to be the only things keeping the company afloat at this point (mid-2012).  In my 8+ years of professional experience, I've never seen a company so accepting of failure and inefficiency, if not outright coddling it.  There really seemed to be zero repercussions for poor performance.

Echoing some of the other comments, much of middle to senior management are severely out of touch with both the big picture and the day-to-day goings on within their departments.  A number of recent hires were hired due to previous relationships/friendships with managers/VP's in their groups, regardless of their lacking relevant work experience.  Definitely too much ""buddy system"" going on.  A recent hire in my former department lacked the requisite skill set for their job... however they were a family friend of an executive, so they were hired without hesitation.

While there has been a decent amount of management (including executive) turnover in the past year, the proverbial ship doesn't seem to be anywhere close to being righted.  An entire business unit was eliminated recently and there has been a steady exodus of tenured employees recently.  My guess is many were pre-IPO employees hoping to hit it big when the company went public, only to have to have to stock flop since going public rendering most stock options worthless.

There is also a seven lack of infrastructure within the company.  Almost no synergy exists between departments, especially the flow of information between engineering/sales.  I've seen new products/features being sold that weren't actually going to be available in the channel for months out.

Where benefits are concerned, while the health benefits are good, the lack of company 401k match stinks.  As a whole, the pay seems to be a touch lower for comparable positions elsewhere.  A big draw for me was the opportunity to work at a start-up preparing to go public.  As mentioned above, due to the poor performance of the company, I'd guess anyone who started at Epocrates within the past 3-4 years is underwater on their stock options. 

Personal growth also seems to be non-existent from my experience.  Speaking from personal experience, I was promised a career path yet never received this in my 2 years with the company.  In lieu of allowing people to pursue areas of interest within the company, the only areas for advancement I saw fell more into the realm of ""no one else wants to do this"".";;Helpful (3);;in San Mateo, CA;San Mateo, CA;;;;;Doesn't Recommend

In healthcare, the company is rapidly growing, They have lots of clients, good pipeline, and excellent growth potential. Quite the contrary, everyone at IncentOne is TOO well paid! Check out the market rate for a developer in the current market. Here they get 30-40% more. Consultants are brought in first, because the company doesn't want to make a mistake hiring the wrong people, but if they people are able to show that they have the right skills, they are quickly transitioned into higher responsibility roles, full-time employee status and benefits. There is a lot to learn in this company, if you are in technology and healthcare business. There is new leadership that's driving growth. CEO is energetic and very competent. Again not sure where the comments come from...some people didn't make it through restructuring that happened a year ago to focus on healthcare business. Life goes on. Everyone who is in the company is well respected and challenged. But ofcourse, if you fail at your job, you won't slide through the cracks not being noticed....leadership notices very quickly.

Unlike what people said below...no incentone doesn't just do gift cards.  It offers technology platform to healthcare clients to manage incentive programs to reduce healthcare costs.  There is a lot of amazing opportunities.

I work until 8pm sometimes, and AC/Heat is on!  The cleaners leave around 9 and they lock the place.

Yes, there will be zero chance of growth if you think this is a company where you can come, take 2 hour smoke breaks, and slide through the cracks.  You will get noticed and escorted out the door quickly.  We give incentives to people to perform and teach our clients that, so we also live it at this company.

As far as i know, every product and deliverable that was due for clients, was delivered in time.  This company takes client deliverables extremely seriously so yes, they add consultants when needed to the team to deliver to clients, but they may not stay too long, and they are paid when the job is done...there is no gun to their heads!!!

There are employees across the company in multiple offices and countries who are smart, friendly, passionate and hard working. Having the ability to sometimes work from home would also be a pro.;"The CEO is a disgrace to the company. He obviously does not know how to run a large company, is completely self absorbed and sees employees as numbers. It trickles down through other management. Decisions are made on a whim and without proper consideration of finances or effects on employees. Let me say that there are some managers in the company who care. Too bad they have no power and are also not considered for their opinions. 

The company lacks integrity, which I believe stems from the CEO. I would actually go so far as to say they lie to their employees as well as outside vendors. Vendors are often not paid on time which results in them blacklisting the company. This means projects take longer to complete. Also, employees are promised certain software releases or updates that then do not happen on time with no explanation except that sometimes ""things don't go as planned."" Don't promise something you cannot fulfill. There was one time that paychecks were delayed due to a human error in the company, and the company did not cover the money for their employees... simply told them that if they had automatic bills coming out they might want to adjust them since paychecks would be late.  

Systems are old, outdated and slow. And worst of all, no one who has the power to change it cares at all. You are not given the proper tools to complete your job, and this leaves employees frustrated, angry, working long hours and without solutions. Clients are disappointed and projects are sometimes not completed on time due to outdated, slow systems.

Employees are asked to wear many hats without proper compensation. If an important employee leaves the company, the responsibilities are given out to other employees with a plea for them to ""come together during this difficult time."" They are overworked and under compensated and rarely appreciated. Most good employees just end up leaving for any job they can get. Compensation is terrible across the company-- I ended up leaving and receiving 50% more in salary for a lower job position. On that note, some positions are paid well. Research salaries and demand at least an average market price if you're going to try and withstand this terrible company.";;Helpful (16);Former Employee - Anonymous Employee;;;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

It is a marriage of two companies. An arranged marriage. And arranged marriages are always challenging, especially when the two entities have different  values, cultures, cadences and even language. To merge it into one entity and make 1+1=3 is difficult to say the least, but I, for my part believe it’s happening. The speed at which the ‘marriage’ was done, and the speed at which execution happens on a day to day basis has made it painful for some individuals who weren’t on board with the new vision or refused to get on board, or simply didn’t have the new skills required for the new company. Thus some very disgruntled employees with negative reviews. But sometimes when trees are pruned they grow stronger and healthier than ever. Typical merger growing pains.. but the worst has past.;"The line is that ‘we are transforming and disrupting healthcare’. Personally I believe this because I see it with my own eyes every day on the platform.  The company is changing healthcare in the sense that it’s allowing doctors around the world to crowd-source and solve difficult cases and talk openly about how to use drugs and approaches to therapy.  That might sound mundane.. but doctors are actually pretty isolated and have never been linked globally via technology in this way. So this means they are using the ‘shared mind’ to work together and improve outcomes.. and that is actually saving lives, saving costs, and doctors are learning from one another all around the world.  So for me it’s amazing to work for a company who is ‘changing the world in a good way’.  I’d rather do this than sell brown sugar water to the world. 
The business model is also transforming into an incredibly valuable model. Again, both entities had to be transformed for this to happen but the potential is massive and the interest level from all kinds of audiences is tremendous.. doctors, pharma, government, all kinds of clients etc.
Lots has been written about the CEO. He is visionary has gotten recognized by the external world for many awards and will take this company to great places. One must recall that he foresaw and took two completely different businesses and merged them to make one super valuable company. Like all ‘disruptive CEOs’, he has a strong personality, and an unwavering vision. He also moves at the speed of light.. so that is difficult for some! He expects people to be not only good at their job but to do it with passion/ purpose.

There's no focus on people, they are not important to the C-suite. But employees in the London and Boston office get candy, so should be grateful!

Having read some of the older reviews on here, I think what I'm experiencing is new - the result of a certain renaissance or blending of the company culture after it acquired Sermo.  I've had a few conversations with the CEO - he's incredibly open-minded, and he has that reality-bending quality to him that seems to get the most out of everyone around him, including himself. The executive team certainly doesn't give any vibe of being off somewhere above the clouds.

From everyone I talk to, there's work to be done basically everywhere.  I imagine that  can frustrate people who need a lot of direction or struggle to define their contributions and road maps/ work plans.  

If you're looking for career growth by way of promotions and incremental expansions to your role, it's probably not the best place to be.

nice office location
very friendly and hardworking international employees";"-not a stable company at the moment - right now they are going through a major restructuring and many people have been laid off. 

-very high employee turnover - in 3-4 years almost the whole company is cleared out. they just can’t retain their people.

-too big on promises and so short on actual commitments - they will do anything to make their employees work harder and long hours and sometimes weekends. staying late at the office is often encouraged and unfortunately the hard work is not a major consideration for the annual salary reviews. if you accept a job with worldone you will be better off negotiating higher salary from the beginning rather than hoping for increases after the annual review. 

- no regard for the well-being of the employees, the management pressures the employees on all projects with the “needed right now attitude”. meetings are are often scheduled before and after the regular working hours, it really is a 24-7 kind of company. 

- there is no information sharing within the organization, the employees have no idea what the long-term goals of the company are, they are simply told what to do. The management often drops order which could make even the authoritarian rule of the Chinese communist party jealous. the most common thing is when the management comes up with a new idea/process/project that has to be implemented right away and everything has to stop whatever they are working on in order to take the new project. the problem is that the project never gets completely finished because the management will come up with another one that will always trump the current one. 


-status/title/seniority - these are incredibly important for the company. if you don't have VP or SVP or EVP you don't get a say in anything. 

- the company is oversaturated with executives and VPs - half of the people there are VPs, directors and other kinds of (made up) titles which looks good on paper but in reality the company is full of bosses and there is no middle management

- rules and stuck-up environment…. Worldone is really big on those. for example - a rookie mistake is leaving your jacket on the back of the chair. you will be scolded very quickly…. other rules include: guys wearing suits and ties, girls serving coffee every time the CEO Peter Kirk requests it and especially during board meetings, no personal items allowed on the desks (apparently it ruins the feng shui), post-it notes are no no, chewing gums are even a bigger NO, cell phone ringing and not being on silent mode are hard learnt lessons. 

 - worldone doesn't tolerate criticism of any form. if you have an opinion about anything you better keep it to yourself because there is only one CEO called Peter Kirk and whatever he commands has to happen, no questions asked. 

- worldone lives in a bubble, completely separated from reality. they have adopted this weird culture of congratulating themselves for mediocre achievements including the banal high-fiving, telling each other how great they are, saying how excellent everything is and that they are going to be the next google and apple (yeah, right...) and how very exciting everything in the company is. very much part of the company cloture are the hollow and superficial buzzwords such as: ""Boom"", ""Here we come"", ""Exciting"", ""Let's keep the momentum"" and others.  The sad thing is that the aforementioned VPs and SVPs think that they can motivate the employees by saying that everything is great without making an effort to address the real issues and give direction to the organization. The management tries to put a positive face and completely ignores the reality - you can't build a company if your employees are overworked, underpaid and unrecognized for their work. 

-   careers prospects - the company doesn't promote from within, unless you are a VP you might become SVP but otherwise promotions within the organization are very rare.

- lay offs - the way worldone handles those is: at 5:45 pm  one of the executives asks you to meet with them, at 5:50pm you are escorted out of the building. there is no mentioning to any of the remaining employees what has just happened because worldone simply doesn't talk about the people who get let go. this is very harmful to the morale.";;Helpful (6);Former Employee - Project Manager;;;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

A total lack of direction and an extremely short-sighted top management will kill your vice in no time and ruin the great potential of the business, dragging you down along the way.

The company is renowned for having dominated the sector a few years ago (roughly 2006 to 2011) only thanks to an outrageously unfair Sales campaign aimed at slashing competition and destabilizing the market. They years that followed have seen it lose ground very rapidly with tremendous effects on its staff: a spate of office closures across the globe, dodgy investors maneuvers at the very top, and endless rounds of ruthless sackings along the way.

Do you want a more specific example? Here it is.

The Translation department made a stellar rise between 2008 and 2017, from the department at the back of the room to the most cost effective one in the whole company, with fantastic improvements in quality of service too. Comes the end of 2017 and, due to its serious financial issues, the company realizes it can no longer afford the department hence they decide to send home the whole European side of the department (i.e. its members based in London) while keeping the 2 members based in Mexico. At the time of the redundancy consultation, the Translation team members affected were told repeatedly that there was no alternative plan in place for the future of the translation function but - guess what? - shortly after SERMO started to employ fresh members in their cheapest operational offices (Mexico and Lithuania), with obvious  negative results for the efficiency of the department itself and the quality delivered (based on what I have heard from reliable sources).

So unless you want to be treated like a disposable piece of junk, stay away from these people and offer your talent and professionalism to people who know what to do with it and how to appreciate it.";;Helpful (7);Former Employee - Anonymous Employee;in London, England;London, England;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

Most managers are friendly, professional and understanding.;The close-knit culture and the family-like atmosphere can lead to favoritism and unnecessary drama or distractions (this can vary based on the team/department you work in). Growth and promotions come with the downside of being given a new position with new responsibilities and challenges, but no increase in pay. This is hugely demoralizing and affects the loyalty of employees as a number of them either choose to remain in their current positions and decline promotions or leave and find employment at alternatives willing to pay them what they are worth.  Some managers aren't as understanding as others (again, varies by teams). Yearly reviews and raises/bonuses utilize an unnecessarily obscure and tedious method, one that is often time-consuming and distracting, to track and determine outcomes that may be frustrating, unfair, or disappointing.

The ""Best Place to Work in NYC"" awards are meaningless--the senior management forces employees to rate the company highly, instilling a pseudo-""Big Brother"" fear of computer monitoring/repercussions.

Instead, everyone at Mr Youth stays until midnight for appearances/fear of being one of the many who are quietly ""removed"" throughout the year. 

Overall, the most notable takeaway from my time at MRY is the agency's reputation for having a ""fun"" and ""tight-knit"" culture being a complete farce, to an almost creepy extent. Like, everyone drinks the Kool-Aid and then drunkenly admits to hating life and the pressure of always appearing psyched to be at work. 

This might seem dramatic, but I want to warn people out there who might be considering a job here. They do an incredible job on the PR/social media front and it misleads a lot of people.

At its core, sales is about connecting with people – and in my role, that includes listening and building connections with our employees. That’s one of the reasons I just finished a round of in-person meetings with the sales staff to discuss our strategic priorities. It sounds like I could have done a better job of explaining how and why we change rates and factors and where billing system fixes fall in our strategy, so I’ll compose a summary of my presentation to share with the team and follow up to check for understanding. 

Regarding compensation, I believe we have the best sales staff in the industry – and our incentive pay reflects that.  Pay is not a taboo subject, so feel free to talk to your supervisor about your concerns.  PEMCO is in a very strong position in our markets, and you and the rest of our sales team play a critical role in that.

• Affordable parking on site
• Current technology
• Some flexible work days/remote availability depending on your role
• Highly subsidized Orca card
• Seattle office is right on bus line";"• HR just checks boxes to comply with rules and standards. ""If you see something, say something"" policy ends there - no follow-through on rule-breakers who take advantage of the system
• Lack of collaboration and true investment in pulling together for the common good between business groups
• Despite the high ratio of women employees, new technology, and upscale buildings, it's still a  ""this is how we've always done it""/ ""old boy network"" environment.  A large percentage of employees have been there 10-30 years and are resigned to not questioning processes or innovating.
• ""Agile"" environment is a pipe dream. This is a place where ideas and motivation go to die. If you want a place with great work life balance then go ahead, take a three-hour lunch for that massage you need 1x a week, but don't expect to be excited about the work you're doing or to feel like you're making an impact. Slow doesn't even begin to describe the pace of change.
• Seattle office location is not near many good options for lunch, but is right on the bus line";"Thanks for taking the time to write a nuanced review, and for your “recommends” rating. You make some keen observations about your time at PEMCO, and some of your comments rang true to me.

One of the things that attracts IT talent to PEMCO is that you can use your technology skills to make a difference here, and expect to work hard – but not to the point of burning out. We want employees to enjoy a flexible work environment, and trust they have the integrity to have this level of flexibility without abusing the privilege.

Change can be difficult, both for people who are resistant to it, and those who want to see it happen at a faster pace. As someone who’s been here for more than 10 years, I know we’ve gone through a tremendous amount of change already – and as technology continues to evolve, we have to evolve with it. We want to encourage fresh ideas, and I believe it’s our role in IT to work with colleagues in our department and across the business to show them the improvement possibilities and help bring them along so they’re more comfortable with change.

Everybody smiles and laughs constantly at work.
2) Benefits are very competitive, including a 200% match on your 401K.
3) Customer service is one of the things on this company that is 100% on the right direction.";"1) Executive team is nice when is time to smile and take pictures, but they do not handle well planning. Decisions are made with no plan in sight. Mostly, because all of them lack enough knowledge to be effective leaders.

2) According to PEMCO, its values are courage, integrity, and responsibility. However, you would barely see those values followed by the executive team, and managers. Even when they lay off people, instead of letting people go with an honest statement, they rather make up a Disney story that at the end of the day nobody believes, it is embarrassing to say the least.

3) For a company this size, it is highly political. Turf wars across different areas, although people do not see it that way. No straight talk is the PNW way, they say. If you want to thrive on this company, you need to be a politician first of all.

4) PEMCO has a HR department that is huge considering its size. Performance evaluation, and other process are inefficient. Executive team, and management are not evaluated at all by subordinates, this reflects lack of courage, and integrity. There are a lot of training coming from HR that is more related to personal growth than professional growth. This is another reason PEMCO is behind compared with its competitors.

5) You would find people with an average tenure of 15+ years. Which you might think is awesome. Truth to be told is that most of that people stay on the company because they do not have the tools to be competitive in the market, so they stay on their comfort zone. This is the case at least of 90% of the employees, so you can see why it is so hard for PEMCO to embrace new ideas, technologies, etc. That's the culture.

6) As a follow up of (5), it is hard for PEMCO to retain highly trained talent. So if you have an education beyond BS, BA, and you value your professional career, then you would find as a challenge that this company will not value your work, just because executives and management do not understand it.

7) There are conflict of interests coming from the top all the time. It is hard to promote values such as integrity and responsibility, when you see management doing the opposite.

8) In summary, this can be a great place for you if you don't have a career based on your education. Otherwise is a professional dead trap.";;Helpful (5);Former Employee - N/A;in Seattle, WA;Seattle, WA;;;Neutral Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

Colleagues are generally very friendly and most have an enthusiasm for their job. Leadership team is open to feedback and implements good suggestions.";"Over the past five years, as the economy began to tank, the company began altering its performance measuring approach from the old school ""you've been here a long time, here's a raise"" to the more modern ""pay for performance"" approach. The company is trying to ensure it stays profitable during a bad economy and this is totally understandable, but unfortunately this couldn't come at a worse time for employees. Employees are looking for stability in order to hang onto their jobs right now, and as this change in culture was a big work in progress there was a lot of uncertainty about what employees are being graded on in order to succeed.

At the end of the day many employees weren't sure if they were doing well or not. Some very good employees were nitpicked over little things that didn't directly affect the goals that were supposedly the important ones of the day, while other employees who universally are known to be subpar would receive praise for how long they've been at the company. The company seemed to have trouble separating their ""performance"" rating culture (the new way) from tenure with the company (the old way). Differences in leadership styles also gives certain employees an advantage: some supervisors just shut down incoming suggestions and make the employee feel bad for even saying anything, while others are very open and receptive to all feedback and actually do something with it when they hear it.

There is serious mismanagement of FMLA at the company. FMLA is supposed to protect an employee's job when they have ongoing medical or family issues that require time away from work, but employees HEAVILY abuse it at PEMCO while supervisors, managers, and HR seem to look the other way. An employee will ask for a day off to go to a ballgame and be denied due to work capacity, then call out sick with an ""FMLA issue"" only to be seen at the train station that evening wearing sports jerseys. Another will be overheard on a personal call saying ""He wants to go to the park? Sure, I'll come get him and take him,"" after which they immediately approach their supervisor and say their child is sick. Unfortunately this abuse is rampant and individuals who practice such unethical behavior continue to work at the company while others lost their jobs during tough times.";;Helpful;Senior Customer Service Representative;in Seattle, WA;Seattle, WA;;;;;Recommends

No, seriously""";I worked at PEMCO Insurance full-time for more than 3 years;For the right level of patience and silence there is good money to be had, and you never feel threatened or unliked. If you're fortunate to have a good management tree above you then you'll be well taken care of.;"I said that it's like Neverland. Did you see the VH1 special ""Man in the Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story""? If not, there's this feeling in that movie that things are great on the surface. But that's only as long as you ""believe"" in Michael. Failure to do so results in people disappearing. Same with Apple and Steve Jobs: If you don't ""believe"" you won't be around for long. 

PEMCO Management is this way. Doesn't matter if what they say is flawed. It doesn't matter if what they want is illogical. Doesn't matter if what they're asking for is risky. Your job is to nod your head and agree. It's especially frustrating, because like Neverland, it's great otherwise (except its location in the worst part of Seattle). 

It's frustrating when you forewarn people that a course of action can only end badly, but because they *think* they know what they're doing, they trailblaze forward blindly. Not a big deal except, when things go south as warned, they don't come to you and say ""I was wrong and I should have listened."" They'll blame you. How? Who knows. But they will. Just like when Michael's peers warned him about his actions and weren't heeded. 

Then there's the hiring process. They favor people from the industry even if they're otherwise incompetent. So maybe you were an insurance sales rep for 30 years but never did any customer service in a call center. You'd be favored over someone who is new to insurance, but has 20 years of call center experience. They assume that you can't learn fast enough. This results in the wrong people getting jobs. Hint: I'm using Customer Service, but it applies to every department hiring, and right now, there's just one. 

The result is a blatant waste of company funds, to the tune of many millions of dollars, simply because Management is too proud to listen to staff and be held accountable for poor decisions.  Just like how Michael wasted millions of dollars despite people telling him to calm down. 

But the next decisions are not about learning from these errors in leadership. They're a prelude to layoffs that are 100% avoidable. Do you really need to buy four different kinds of tablets? Do you really need huge displays in HR that nobody uses or sees? Do you really need 360 degree conference room video when nobody uses video? Expensive shades on the windows? Tricked out cafeteria when you knew you weren't keeping the building long-term? 

Thing is the managers like ""cool"" things. They've been swayed by Amazon, Apple, etc. But they fail to realize that PEMCO is not and never will be on the level with those companies. I agree with the other reviews that say that PEMCO refuses to act properly for its size, and if you choose to work here, make sure you reconcile with yourself that you are expendable, even when you're needed.";;Helpful;Former Employee - Anonymous;;;;;Negative Outlook;Approves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

I met some very dedicated, hard working people, many of whom just wanted a fair deal.

I was grateful to get a job when I was hired.

They do promote from within, but it is pretty political.";"No raises.  No merit raises for any reason.  The last year I worked there the CEO gave himself a 13% raise, but told everybody at the annual meeting that the dividends were in jeopardy, so nobody got a raise.  He left out: except him.  (And that doesn't even include his bonus!) Does he think that CCPs can't read annual reports?  And that was after insisting that the people taking the calls are the most important people in the company.

I worked 3,000 hrs. and received a 15 cent per hour differential.  What they didn't tell you was that it was paid as a ""bonus"" on a separate line from your salary, so they didn't have to pay you overtime for that extra 15 cents!  Or include that when they were computing bonus. (So they could afford to give the CEO a 13% raise?)

The medical benefits were a joke.  You got $1000 coverage if you maxed it out, but your premiums were $1000 whether you used it or not...why bother?  At least in a savings account I would be getting interest. Now they don't even bother...they tell you to check out Obamacare.

Generally, the only thing this company was generous with was criticism.  CCPs are monitored and reviewed constantly.  The people providing the ""coaching"" have never been trained on how to interact with their employees.  They generally are CCPs who have performed well and have been promoted into supervisory roles.  And good CCPs do not necessarily make good supervisors.  Sadly they end up running more people off than they help perform better.

The whole industry needs to find a way to get away from this ""catch them doing something wrong"" mentality.  Instead of focusing on mistakes, focus on good calls, providing examples and praising people in meetings instead of this constant, critical environment.

You start off in training with around 20-30 other new employees, and typically training lasts from 4-8 weeks, depending on the program. Much of the training is actually the trainer troubleshooting employee tech issues one person at a time. So much time was wasted on computer configuration (which was initially drilled in our heads that if we weren't completely ready to go by day 1 then we would be cut from training - yeah right! Some people trained over wifi and not a hard wired connection and didn't lose their jobs.)
- In production on my particular program, all of the employees are logged into a chat room, and there is absolutely no coaching/team leader/room support at all. You are told to place the customer on hold to look up the answer to their issue in a matrix, or to ask your teammates for help in the room. With back to back calls, nobody has time to answer questions in the chat room!
- Another huge issue it's impossible to get the team leaders' attention. You're told to IM them for an immediate response to a problem. You see them online and send IMs but may not hear back from them the entire shift. Meanwhile, your email inbox is being spammed with a plethora of emails regarding birthdays, newsletters, and updates to the knowledge database. I receive around two dozen emails per shift which I have NO time to read.
- You are paid for being logged into the phone and along calls. Period. You aren't paid for the many emails you have to plow through and respond to, and you aren't paid for mandatory surveys about the job that you need to fill out.
- The pay is an absolute nightmare. Minimum wage for training, $9.00/hour until you hit 3,000 hours, where you're then raised fifteen whole cents to $9.15 and hour. Three thousand hours of being cussed out by customers, Googling information for them, and having to kiss their rear end because God forbid you don't do everything in your power to appear them for a ""5"" on your survey.
- Alpine/Sykes doesn't care if the customer's issue is resolved whatsoever. As long as they hit that ""5"" on their telephone survey. You're told that you're rewarded for meeting all of your metrics (and thereby earning 25¢ more per hour that month), which is another lie.
- Tech issues run rampant with them applications you use, particularly the Softphone and Citrix. You will be told to ""Loli"" (reboot) your programs multiple times per day and because there is no real problem besides the programs running like crap, you aren't paid for the tons of time you lose. Case in point: during 2014 I only grossed $10,000 - rarely was there a paycheck with a full 40 hour week - most of the time I could barely hit 25 hours due to tech issues. I was told to grab overtime hours if I wanted more. So all of the time you spend ""messing"" with your computer is completely unpaid.
- HR is another big joke. I had another employee sending disgusting inappropriate IMs to me and telling me that he was drunk on shift. I reported this to HR. Within the hour, my team leader became annoyed and standoffish to me, like I was the problem. HR asked tons of questions but never followed up after the day of the report. I found out from another coworker that the employee harassing me was just told to block me on IM and kept his job (""sexual"" harassment, according to the employee handbook, is a terminable offense, by the way)
- Paid time off must be earned, and it's not something that you can even use in an emergency (such as a same-day illness.) Even days off without pay must be scheduled weeks in advance, and usually aren't approved because the program is swamped with 20 to 30 minute call queues every day. Don't bother purchasing the benefits package either, $160 per month and pays for nothing. I had a blood draw that I ended up paying $880 out of pocket for. Alpine's ""insurance"" covered $25.00. NO JOKE.
- Employment is not guaranteed. Client programs pull out and completely offshore their workforce all the time, so twice within three years I have moved onto a new program. Some other employees aren't so lucky, and end up laid off or fired to meet staffing needs.";;Helpful (5);Work At Home Customer Care Professional;in Denver, CO;Denver, CO;;;Negative Outlook;No opinion of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

I've been on 2 different programs and both have been nice. If you don't like where you're at you can move to another program. Hours are reasonably flexible. PTO can be given as paid time off or a pay bonus. 401k contributions are always a plus. I've never had any pay issues or problems getting tech pay when there are legit tech issues that are coming from their systems. I have a ton of unpaid time off I can use when I need to not be at work or simply can't make it. With this type of work from home job, communication is very important. Anytime I have an issue, as long as I let someone know, it gets fixed. There are opportunities for advancement if you want them. There are monthly bonuses every month you meet the call time and other metrics. There is often overtime available. When I'm off shift nobody bothers me so I can truly be away from work. There are pay bumps when you've worked X number of hours. I don't have to wait around for the next shift to come in and relieve me from duty, which is a major plus for me. My training was great! I definitely felt prepared when I started taking calls that first day. Some days aren't very busy and there is a lot of time to do whatever between calls as long as you can still hear when a call comes in. Other days, it's busier with little down time. For the most part, the people I have worked with seem to love what we do and genuinely care about everyone's success. There are plenty of ways to submit ideas and problems to the company, to the client, and to your immediate supervisor. There are always positive things happening here. When a change turns out to be not such a good idea, they listen to us and fix it! Essentially, if you do what you're supposed to do you won't have any problems. With what I take home in pay, I'm able to pay my mortgage, my car payment, all my other bills, and still have enough left over for savings and a bit of fun! I really enjoy this job. I made significantly more with my previous job, but I am glad I traded the extra pay for the freedom, time, and lack of stress I get here. I would absolutely do it again. It would take a lot to get me to work somewhere else.;"Back to back calls all day long are exhausting, but thankfully rare.
Tech issues can be frustrating, but you still get paid as long as you follow procedure.
There is a zero tolerance noise policy, so if a customer or supervisor hears people or pets or whatever while during your shift there is a good chance you will be seeking employment elsewhere.
Starting costs, for me, were a bit high. With the background checks, fingerprinting, drug testing, phone/headset purchase, and getting actual phone service in my home, I almost didn't do it. I'm glad I did though.

Att was a great program, the trainers were knowledgeable & very informative with everything making it very easy to learn & they made sure we all participated so it would be easier to grasp.

The majority of the class was spent without him, while he put us in breakouts for 'self discovery', & sometimes would accidentally take himself off of mute and we could hear him on the phone with his girlfriend while he was supposed to be 'working on something'.

And it's legit work-at-home. The pros are that it's better than working at McDonalds. And maybe that should be Alpine's motto ""we're better than working at McDonalds"". 

For many people working at home is a necessity due to their situation. And this job satisfies that. Also, you can move around the country and still keep your job. 

If you need to work at home and you can live on less than $1500 net income per month, this job may be for you.";"The company is cheap, cheap....oh, did I mention CHEAP?  To start off, you don't cost them office space, electric, heat, or computer/phone equipment. And if you don't have a landline or a phone headset, you get to pay for those too. And what's their benefit to you? A dollar over min wage and NO benefits. I don't care what it says about health care, they offer NO health insurance. They offer LIFE insurance. Kind of a big difference. And no doubt they make money on selling it to you.

To start working for Alpine, I had to dig up around $100 to install a landline, get a headset and notarize papers to send to them for the application. 

Ok, moving on. You will NEVER get a raise at the same position. EVER. Been there for 10 years? Who cares, $9/hr. They do offer an incentive if you happen to be one of the top performers....50 cents more per hour....or $30 after taxes per paycheck. Oh, and you can lose this if they think you weren't performing well enough. It's not permanent.

Almost NO training. They will spend time with these worthless get-togethers, but you will get drilled in call reviews for something you were never taught....as if you knew it, somehow. The main reason I do well is because of past experience with companies that did train me. Alpine is paying me low wages benefiting from my past experience outside the company.

No benefits. No paid vacation. They do throw you a bonus, but outside of this, at full-time you're looking at around $1300 per month. 

They will do their best to cheat you out of time. You can always dispute it, but hey they write the paychecks. You'll find hours missing and be given some lame excuse why.  Be prepared to be available 40 hours, just don't expect to get paid 40 hours.

No paid holidays. You don't work, you don't get paid. You get to work non-fed holidays as well at straight pay. Easter? New Years Eve? Christmas Eve? You may as well be working at Walmart. 

The job is basically a min-wage job at home. But it's not a skill-less job at all. You need to be tech savvy and depending on your program, you need to be intelligent enough to handle calls about your client. You have to read up and TRAIN YOURSELF to handle your calls.  

Going back to cheap. The company offers NO health care and yet the CEO sends out emails telling people how to be fit.  Okay I guess that's his compensating for not helping with health care.. Then he gets team leads to beg workers for donations to his pet charity for heart research.  These are people that make $9/hr, many part-time that's he's begging.

Training was to be 4 weeks and even that would probably be iffy, but if you studied outside of training and really applied yourself and maybe even had knowledge of the product from your own experience, you might expect to do OK. 

On the day I was to start training, I was told that I was working for a different company, no computer and a schedule change that wouldn't work for me but I needed a job badly so I rearranged kids, doctors, school and my life to fit. I was told training would be 2 weeks not 4 weeks. They hired people with no computer experience at all and instead of training, we got to watch LIVE via our own computer, while the instructor cleaned cache and cookies and updated students PC software and browsers. It was so frustrating when not only did we NOT get enough training but the software we needed to use for work, was not available to train with and it was given on the 1st day of work after 9 days of ""TRAINING"" if you could call it that.

It was anything but customer service. I am a computer software expert, 20 years experience in IT and had no idea how to maneuver through the various different programs (5 of them) that must be running on your PC at all times while working and besides interacting with 2 customers at a time, you were to be working back and forth trough all the software, soft-phones, incoming calls, talking to supervisors and waiting for answers to give to the customer, what a nightmare. That is not service and the customers were really upset and angry after waiting forever to get someone who would either lose the call or did not know how to find an answer and keep them on the phone over an hour without resolving anything, It was so humiliating. If that was not all bad enough, that day I was told I would be working Saturday, not Sunday after telling them from the start that I don't work on Saturday, ever at all. They knew it before I was officially hired and after all that, they changed my schedule a 3rd time with no notice when there were others who were perfectly willing to trade with me and work on Saturday.

Account manager is very supportive and mostly available, client we work for is interesting and the customers are appreciative and fun to talk to. Small raise from client with newest job role (kind of a con, still vastly underpaid, 3rd role since program start). 

Initial training was at minimum wage but my first up-training was paid at my rate at that time ($9.5) and my most recent up-training was paid at the new rate ($10/hr) before we'd even started taking those call types. OT was based off that rate as well, which was very generous of them, all things considering. 

Application and onboarding process was very straightforward, seems like they'll hire anyone. Depending on the program they will provide you with a computer to work on. It was a downgrade from what I'm used to but I'm sure this is a pro for most people. 

I'll talk about this in cons too but the customers have an opportunity to leave surveys, and while not required (yet) to get a certain number in a month it is really rewarding seeing their comments and knowing they appreciate you :)

Also I've seen a lot of reviews mention they don't calculate your pay correctly or compensate your for tech issues on their end. This has not been my experience at all. Payroll system is super easy to understand. Every penny is accounted for on my paychecks, my direct deposit comes a day early (yay!), and they've paid me every time their systems went down while I was working. (Con: Systems will go down while you're working).";"LOW PAY, little to no advancement opportunities, can't transfer before you have done a year on your current program and they seem to dislike the idea of dual programs, incompetent team leads/trainers, you are treated as insignificant even if you are a top 5 performer, just to name a few. Small lunch/break windows that you only get if you work over 4 - 6 continuous hours. Having a 10 min split between two 3+ hour shifts will not net you a lunch, sorry. 

You do have to get their approved equipment before you start working, which can be pricey and they don't reimburse for it. Training was mostly unorganized and I'm only so good at my job because of my previous experience and outside study. I would not expect to be able to perform my job properly with just the training they provide. This seems to be the norm based on other reviews. 

Micro managing is a very real problem. Every little thing needs to be approved, which I've honestly stopped bothering with because it makes your calls longer (example: you have to ask for permission in the room to transfer a customer, TL is doing who knows what and never sees it, customer on line gets frustrated waiting for no reason, possible bad survey marks, AHT goes up, TL finally sees it but damage is done to metrics and then they wonder why call time is so high).

Surveys have a couple of questions about rating the client (in addition to rating you of course). One of these fields is counted in with your score and can bring it down, messing up your survey average for something you have no control over. Its hilarious how they think a 10 minute support call is supposed to change a person's entire perspective over what is usually a multiple year long relationship. Crazy.

Other things that other people mention but don't bother me so much: little health benefits, no scheduling flexibility, self paid background check.

Oh and the helpdesk people are awful here, google your issue if you need help. I think they're outsourced as well which should be less surprising than it is.";;Helpful (4);Current Employee - Tech Support;;;;;Neutral Outlook;No opinion of CEO;Recommends

Schedules would change with no notice and you had to look every day.
No planning of home life. MUST be 100% noise free. If the dog barks next door or a lawn is being mowed and it is heard over your phone you'll probably be fired. We had been told it would be good to let the neighbors know we were working at home and they needed to be quiet. LOL!
You have to invest in the equipment they require. Aside from having to buy a new computer because  I had the specifications they required. I paid for a background check, a usb headset, a phone with headset compatibility, an extra hardline phone line, printer and various office supplies. You have to print quite a bit unless you are good at taking fast notes.
I had to sign a contract for a year on a job then was  ""ramped down"" and laid off  from the position in less than 3 months along with over a hundred other people. We were on the schedules, go in for 15 minutes and told to ""jump off"" (essentially go home)  and the hours diminished daily until no hours scheduled with no explanation. Left with no job and no compensation. We were told to file for unemployment in our state. I was put back in the job pool but still listed as employed at that program. You have to commit but they don't.
I got an offer after 2 months. I got everything I needed, signed the contracts, etc. and they said I was hired, then informed me my internet speed wasn't high enough for that specific position. I am limited where I live so I got put back into the job pool. Again, I had to commit but they didn't.
A month later I was offered a job again. Hired. I was told that since I hadn't worked for them (although I was still ""employed"" by them and available to work the entire time) I had to go back to minimum wage, even after I had already signed a contract that I would get paid what my last pay rate was. I had to sign a new contract in order to take the position offered at minimum wage. ALL training is paid at your state minimum wage.
 I asked for training help and was ignored many times and when it got time to jump in and take calls  I didn't feel adequately trained on the phone system they provided. They told me to ""breathe"" and just do it. It didn't work out well when their program crashed my phone line and they wanted proof that my phone company shut off my line. It wasn't my phone company! So no proof. I was called a liar by the leader who wasn't even there to see what the issues were. Then told that if I had proof of the issues I could come back. Why would I want to work for someone so unprofessional to call an employee a liar, before proof, without knowing what happened? 
They rarely take responsibility for any tech issues, their fault or not.
You have to be willing to live your life around this job and jump through a LOT of hoops.
 I was told that the training is just to get you the resources and equipment to use for the job. (I have this saved in an email) You have to teach yourself how to use them to be good at your job. You don't get paid for all the training. You have to do lots of research out of class to actually help customers. If I wanted that I would go to college instead of just a job. 
Don't depend on this company to pay your bills. You don't know how long you will actually be getting a pay check.

Also, you do have a set schedule and like any job, you're expected to show up on time, be back on time from breaks, etc.  The company has about 50 different companies they do call center stuff for, so there are always different options. Many flexible hours and all shifts. Pay is minimum wage for your state during training, after that ..... 8-10/hr if you're lucky.

** I worked at AA for 4 weeks shy of 1 year. I loved my job. I worked on their video game console project. My QA's were perfect. However, a sneaky little rating system called QOS - quality of service - killed me.  You are rated based on surveys that customers fill out after their call. You might get 1 survey back out of 35 or so. The thing here is, the number you're being graded on is NOT their opinion of YOU... but on their opinion of M*****ft (the parent company) as a whole company. This means that even if you did everything awesomely, you may still get a bad score because of policy issues. 

Also, anything technical such as a power outage, internet issues, etc.... those are considered YOUR IT problems.. and you do not get paid for the time off for those. Also, you have to eat into your time bank for it, which can end up costing you your job via points.

Also, be aware that they promise you a raise at the 1 year mark..... Interestingly, out of the 20 people in my starting class...

You will need to accept a lot of blame for things that aren't your fault, that are the result of incompetent communication; which I suspect is simply either over-worked managers, apathy, or a mix of both. It's sad, because for all the time they spend fixing mistakes and going crazy over last minute implementations, they could save at least half of it, and probably some really good employees, if they just bothered to communicate in a timely manner. They would also be able to funnel that extra time into timely trainings, ensuring their employees are paid and scheduled as they should be and in alignment with what they're told and probably retain some really good talent at really low pay.

- If program has it, there are some good ""Top Performer"" benefits like increased pay, pilot programs, and access to devices before the agents below Top Performer get a chance to get access to it.

- Stable schedule

- ""Moving Up"" opportunities

- Easy to follow learning practices

- If program has it, your are supplied with equipment to do your job

- Time and a half pay on holidays

- Significant pay increase for working ""x"" hours overtime

- Resources are always available to do your job correctly

- Very strict security policy. This is a pro because protecting account information, whether it is yours or the clients, is very important. If you risk it, you are on corrective action, and if you do it again, you are terminated with no appeal whatsoever.

- Certain discounts on select programs like Costco, 1800Flowers, DiscountPC.net, etc.

- Can give away shifts so other agents can take them. This can be good if you're looking to take a holiday off.

- Strong emphasis on being empathetic and listening to customer issues. Can build character.

- 2-4 Quality Assurance call reviews a month, not micromanaged.

- Very caring and understanding management. They were in the agents shoes at some point, which helps them become good at what they do.";"- Requirement to work Weekends and Holidays (if scheduled). Holidays are usually considered ""Blackout days"", and if you don't work them, you risk termination. Unless you have given away your shift and another agent has taken it.

- Sometimes constant or frequent policy changes

- No ""paid"" time off. You do accrue hours to take days or time off, but you will not get paid for it. There is a new program where you can opt for two weeks pay, or the equivalent of two weeks pay at the end of the year (if I'm not mistaken.).

- Potential burnout due to back to back calls at certain times of the day

- Really strict on customer interaction, which may not be a bad thing, but you will be corrected if you don't attempt to build rapport with customers, which can be stressful at times.

- No pay raises unless you move up to become a ""Team Lead"", ""Trainer"", or are on the ""Top Performer"" program.

- Really dependent on customer satisfaction surveys. The surveys can be skewed based on how the customer fills it out (which agents have no control over), which can be detrimental to moving up in the program. Basically, the agent has to make sure and try and build that rapport and do the best they can every call. For example, if the customer marks the agent as a 8-10, but rates the company as a 4-6, you get the ""Bottom Box"" score. The company should be rated near your ratings, which may seem unfair.

Bonuses and pay raises promised but rarely given.  Having to fight for every dollar you earn or are supposed to receive. Embarrassingly low wages.  I'm not asking for 20 dollars an hour to work customer service.  But I would like to be working for more than a dollar over my state's minimum wage.  Benefits aren't benefits.  Health insurance is a bottom dollar system with few benefits (read hospitalization only coverage, no well patient visits)  that you'd do better to save your money and look on your own for health insurance.  The company will nickel and dime you for your time.  If there's a second that you're not actively taking calls for them, you're docked pay and this includes those times you're doing required training for them reading required emails from them or even rebooting your Alpine provided computer because your necessary work program has frozen you're docked pay for these times.  While I may continue to be an employee at this company, I have joined a class action lawsuit against them because of this docked pay.  Another issue is if you join their ""top performers"" program.  The basics of their ""top performers"" programs is that they get different incentives to offer customers in order to generate better metrics.  Not logging calls into the system if the call is a known poor survey driver, Giving customers bribes in exchange for more positive surveys.  But the problem with this ""top performers"" program is that they're given no extra money baseline, for being a part of this program.  You do however get increased call volume while the regular performers take the top performers' overflow.  So more responsibility for no extra pay.  You are ""paid"" in bonus programs for receiving 100% positive surveys.  And after a year in this ""top performers"" program, while being subject to metrics that do not support a work/life balance (ie no absenteeism you cannot get sick in a year or you're removed from the program.  ie your adherence to your schedule must remain above 90% and this means taking your breaks on time.  No long calls that would cause you to miss your break or you'll wind up getting kicked out of the top performers) after being subject to all of those standards for a year, you will receive a substantial pay raise.  That is if you remain in the program and the company does not lose the client as they have recently done and have done before.  I indicated to my boss that I had no desire to move to top performers even though I exceed the metrics of those top performers because every 3 months I like to enjoy a day off as well as knowing their tech issues, there is no way to stay in that program for a year straight to receive the carrot on the stick of the pay increase.";;Helpful (4);Current Employee - Anonymous Employee;;;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

This is amazing.";"The difficulty with applying for Alpine Access is that I bought all the equipment up front, had an interview with them, they said I was a good fit, but they were not able to match me with a job immediately.  So, I ended up paying for a corded phone, landline phone service, USB headset, and headset for a phone, but with no job to use it for.  My best advice would be to look into other work at home companies in addition to applying for Alpine Access because there is no guarantee that the company will have job openings in your area.  

I am not saying do not apply to Alpine Access, but I would recommend applying to one or two other companies that you think fits well with your skills and interests.  By doing that, you will increase your chance of getting a job immediately and not have wasted extra money on unnecessary equipment.  

Honestly, I would recommend  first ensuring that you are hired by Alpine Access or some other work at home company and then go to amazon or ebay and buy the equipment shipped out first class, priority, next day or whatever time you need it by.  In my case, I spent a lot of time looking for a headset for a corded phone.  Most stores do not sell them.  Instead, most stores sell headsets made for computers.  So, I had to special order it from ebay.  The issue with that is now I am working for a company that does not need a headset for a phone but for a computer, so I had to buy another headset. 

 Trust me, buying the equipment once you are offered the position helps you save your money.  I know Alpine Access says to buy the equipment in advance, but from experience I would not recommend doing that!! On the bright side, I am starting with a good work at home company, so going through Alpine Access' application process did help me to further develop my interview skills.  I hope this helps people who are thinking about applying for Alpine Access.  Again, I am not trying to bad mouth Alpine, but I am telling applicants to be realistic because they may not have an immediate opening, even if you do well on your interview.  Just look at other companies as well so that you dont get behind on your bills waiting for Alpine Access to call or email you!";;Helpful (3);;;;;;;;Doesn't Recommend

But is it really worth it?""";I worked at Alpine Access  for more than a year;You get to work from home. No gas money needed. No car. No maintenance for your vehicle. You get a paycheck.;"1. Some of the upper management is so disconnected with the agents that you will feel like your out on an island alone at times. If you get further then a month you will see this happen. And before you know it you will constantly feel like the only time you are contact by anyone is if they want you to work extra hours or to correct a mistake you have made. Rarely do they take you aside to commend you for doing a job well done or to let you know you are actually appreciated. 

2. Understaffed constantly for high call volume projects. If you plan on having a life at all prepare to be disappointed. You will find yourself overworked and getting more hours then you know what to do with before its all over. If you are a robot this will be fine for you, but for the typical person you will find yourself burning the candle at both ends in not time. 

3. Huge turnover rate. This ties into point 2 but honestly, when you have so many agents quit on you constantly, not only requiring you to pay to train others and take the time to train the replacements there is something wrong with how you are running things.

4. Pay. This is a huge deal. Firstly, any company that starts you off at your States min wage is basically saying that they would pay you less if they could but its illegal. This sadly is not something unique to Alpine but it must be said. Don't expect to get paid much for your efforts. Even if you get a promotion and start working your way up, don't expect more then a .50 cent raise if that. 

5. Advancement. This ties in with the pay issue. First, you wont get paid squat more for more responsibilities. But most important, its not REALLY that you are being advanced in position its more that your getting a tiny sum more on your pay check and taking on more roles. Expect that if you get promoted you will be doing the same thing you were doing before as well. You can find yourself jumping between multiple positions in one shift and it can really make your head start to swell. 

6.Technical Issues. The systems they implement to get the job done fail constantly, now sure this can be expected to some degree in a digital work environment but honestly it gets old fast and you will find yourself getting very frustrated, on top of how frustrated you already are. This I do know just adds to the degradation of all the agents morale. 

7. Terrible bedside manner. What I mean by this is typically all the agents are in the same room for tech issue announcements/questions etc... Agents are called on constantly for things they have done wrong and in the public chat arena. It seems that all the coach's and higher ups are not trained or told that they should keep these kinds of discussions private rather then berating or correcting them for all to see. This also leads to low morale. 

8. Insane scheduling and email systems. Remember, typically if you pick your hours at the start of the job offer, not after you have gotten your feet wet. This is all well and fine and most jobs will ask you what your availability is. This is a little different, don't plan on every really making changes to your schedule without fighting tooth and nail, and even then it wont happen unless your lucky. And when it comes to email they enjoy sending out mandatory meeting emails and such to an email system you cannot access unless you are on the VPN. So that Mandatory meeting you were supposed to be at today? Well didn't you get the email? They probably sent it out the VERY SAME DAY. Who does this? Who in their right mind schedules meetings and all these other kinds of things the same day, let alone only hours before even when agents may be off that day. Just plain bad planning and horrible management. 

Conclusion:
Working from home is cool at times. You will eventually get cabin fever and depending on the project you end up on, you may just end up hitting that wall very quickly. Bad pay. Mind numbing work. If you need a paycheck go for it. If your only option is to work from home, there are far better work @ home projects out there. In my opinion. If you MUST get a job with this company, go into it trying to earn a little bit of coin till you find something better. This is not a career. It is a paycheck.

Some time off of phones for E-mail. Flexible. O/T opportunities, Jump on/Jump Off opportunities. I've been working call centers a long time, so I'm a bit burnt out on phones. This provided me the opportunity to get some relief from that. The calls were generally easy, but the system is slow and old-fashioned compared to most of the ordering systems I've worked on.;"The pay is embarrassingly low. Training was a little disappointing as I wasn't as prepared as I felt I should be going in. Training in the ""training system"" was much different than the steps you take in the ""live"" one. You can't use your employee discount online which is inconvenient if you don't live near a store. There are some policies that are just ridiculous. While they do a great job of empowering you to do whatever you can for a customer, there are some things where the ""client"" is willing to do so little that it's inexcusable. The worst thing about the job is that it is advertised as an E-mail support with ""help with phones as needed"".but ""PRIMARILY"" phones. I can't tell you how many times, this was told to us before we began training. The training was also e-mail focused, but it wasn't long before most of us got the feeling that we would be phone reps trained for e-mail and that's exactly what it ended up being. Rarely was I scheduled for any e-mail shifts. The only time I worked e-mails was when the phones were slow, i picked up a giveaway shift, or e-mails were so slammed that I was called off the phones to help out. (which is a nice little gift that you admittedly don't get at most call centers) I was called off of phones often enough that it made the job much more pleasant for me. Perhaps it was because I wasn't as fast as the top performers, but I held my own, and I don't believe in shabby, one-liner e-mail responses that come from those top producers. It's insulting to the customer, and just a bad look for the company. I wanted to represent them well.  The e-mail shifts are given to shift leaders and people who can pump out 11+ emails per hour. If that's the case, they should say so. The only reason I accepted this job at $8.00/hr is because I didn't want the pressure of doing phone work 30hrs/wk. I would have applied for one of their other positions that paid more if I'd known I was going to be on the phones more often than not anyway.";;Helpful (5);Former Employee - E-mail Support Representative;in Salt Lake City, UT;Salt Lake City, UT;;;Neutral Outlook;No opinion of CEO;Recommends

They don't even have it set up with people taking calls there. So any reviews that you see from Denver are more than likely Alpine Staff trying to make it look better. Alpine is NOT focused on the employees in any way. I was hired on at 9.50/hr. Within a year I did get a promotion and was raised to 11/hr.  After my promotion I was hit with sooooo much work. 60 to 80 hours a week. They didn't want to pay me for those hours. (But I got my money, I can't say how though.) So then I was told, ""In the future be sure that you get pre-approval for every hour that you need to work."" The funny thing was, a regular week of work with paperwork included would easily take 50 hours. But they only wanted to pay me a lot less hours a week. So with all these big promises of ""Oh you're so great!! We're going to work you up!! You're going to be a manager before you know it!! We believe so strongly in you!!"" I worked a lot of hours for free. &lt;---Stupid me.
I eventually did get the promo they were promising. They wanted me to do more work, with no extra pay. 

I was so excited, thinking Finally I'm getting some more money and more responsibility.

So I ended up getting a ton more work, waiting on them to discuss my pay. Then they said ""We've decided that you are NOT going to get a raise. More was said but I can't disclose it.

I started look for another job as soon as I heard that.
Alpine is focused on money. Always money. There are no real benefits. Their medical is about $600 to $700 for a family per month.

I have never had a job that treated people like this before - they cut our pay, didn't provide sufficient training (it was just play time during that six months, so we were totally unprepared for the onslaught we received once we started taking actual calls), and had system issues daily.  The job is extremely stressful and the clients demand performance that is impossible to reach.

The stress is HIGH and you are pretty much on your own at the start.  the job sounds fun and exciting at first, but if you have not had exp on call centre beware as this is not as fun, also though some people can go through it without Xbox experience, the best thing is having experience.  You are paid at your state´s minimum wage while training, and the rest is 9.50... you can fail your evaluations by silly things, I failed one because I said the word ""hacked"" so you ar monitored 24/7 and if lets say a customer is pissed and wants to talk with  a supervisor, the trainer obligated us to talk tot hat customer. Our trainer was unprofessional and she ate  while explaining, and sometimes even choked on her food and it would be awful. Bear in mind the people training you will usually we on the jbo a few months before you, and  most were recently promoted to trainer so most of them cant explain or teach, so if you want to be succesful, you MUST read a lto on your own, and once you take calls, be prepared to on your own time go  back and re read the cases and make sure they all were closed, ope or escalated properly if you have issues with your tools.

I barely ask questions in chat but when I do even if I got confused or need a refresher we get ""remember your training"" and you are stuck on with the customer, if your tools are failing and you request help, they deny it, if you are quiet on the phone like if you are listening to an upset customer, and you cant really small talk, they wil dock off points for tht so if you are good at small talk, and enjoy people yelling at you, and having to deal with bratty kids this is for you. I ´m still on the job, but all the micromanaging, is annoying and not worth it, Also, we are told the shift commitment is 11pm for example  but they do not tell you this is 11pm MST, so you cna be on the phones up to around 3am, if its a long issue so be wary of that if accepting a ""closer shcedule"".......... besides that Iwould not recommend the job, only if you are desperate, try different departments, not xbox, or sprintm because you ahve to deal with TOO MUCH stuff for the pay, Billign, collections, prepaid codes, accounts, reseting accounts, hacked acounts,  connectivity etc etc..............................its too much stress to be honest.";;Helpful (5);Customer Care Professional;in Fort Myers, FL;Fort Myers, FL;;;;Disapproves of CEO;

First off, the information is highly outdated, and has almost no practical value to the agent.  It would appear that the company has attempted to create a balance between those who are knowledgeable about the console and Live server, and those who have absolutely no clue what either are.  The problem here is that they provide technical information the caliber of which is meant for a professional with respect to Networking Issues, and also provide information that is highly outdated.  I found it extremely difficult to stay engaged during the training, and was often reprimanded for correcting the information we were being provided. 

Now let's discuss life with Alpine after OJT: I get that with new programs and companies there is going to be a bit of lag time, and a period of disorder while everyone because acclimated to operating norms, but this has been a roller coaster ride that no entry level employee should have to endure: Our first week, our ""Mentor"" disappeared for a week without leaving any instructions, and the only communication we got from our ""Senior Team Lead"" was that our mentor was ill and wouldn't be in for awhile.  So you have 15 brand new agents stuck in limbo, without a clue what to do.  Okay, so there is a leadership vacuum, someone needs to step up and try to support the team, right?  Wrong, one very much oversteps their bounds when this is done, and is then wearing a bullseye because their Senior Team Lead is apparently easily threatened.  So for the next two months a CCP on our team pretty much ran it, while our Mentor disappeared and reappeared like a prop in a magic act, still with no intervention from his boss. 

Let's pause for a moment to evaluate this, because this is what really bothers me: There is no communication from leadership of any kind, and a brand new employee is the only person stepping up to provide support for their team?  This brand new employee has no tools to provide guidance, and so wages a battle with these people to get the team they have been leading adequate support, and there is something wrong with this?  Get real Alpine, you dropped the ball and the guy stepped up to do a job your inadequate management staff just isn't capable of doing.  I would think you would want someone like that in the captains chair, but apparently the general idea is to drown him until he leaves: bravo, yet another ""intelligent"" move on your part.

So where were we?  Oh, yes, life at Alpine.  So you can expect to have no support and absent leadership, but you can also expect to have to contend with near constant technical issues that are always your fault.  Their system goes out program wide, and it was your ISP who is at fault.  Yeah, I was left in a cloud of ""huh?"" myself, but it happens.  Alpine's ""Help Desk"" will look at your system when there is an issue, and proceed to tell you that your system is FUBAR, but can't tell you what exactly the problem is, or how you correct it.  In fact, when asked, many of them flat out tell you they don't know, but it's still your fault.  They provided minimum requirements for the job, and as long as your equipment meets those standards, one could form a legal argument around the lack of pay per the employee agreement for technical issues that cannot be clearly diagnosed as having anything to do with the ""host"" system.  We will, however, leave that discussion for a later date.

So we have training that has no practical basis, absent leadership, and technical issues a plenty.  Let's top that off with non-existent benefits, and a paycheck the likes of which would make you both sob and laugh at the same time.  There is no real advancement structure, and their supposed evaluation process is a joke.  Someone already called their metrics out pretty clearly: if a customer doesn't like what you have to say, because you have no choice but to say it, your employment with Alpine is on the line.  You can empathize until you are blue in the face, but most people are simply incapable of separating the person from the policy.  It's like the waitress that brings you the under cooked steak: your tip often reflects the error made by the cook, not the waitress, because the expectation is that she should have some how been able to psychically prepare you food just as you expect it to be prepared.  There is no difference here, and absolutely no consideration given to the fact that you dealt with the customer exactly as you were trained to.  We would also discuss benefits, but there really isn't anything to discuss: you'd save about $500 a year over just paying for everything out of pocket, if you didn't also have to pay for the insurance they provide.  Vacations are also non-existent: you earn un-paid time off like normal employees earn paid time off.";;Helpful (10);Customer Care Professional;in Denver, CO;Denver, CO;;;;;Doesn't Recommend

Alpine claims you save so much in terms of travel cost, and business attire, but that's a complete overstatement. The pay for my program started as $10, then my group was bumped up to $11 for a few months, since we took on more responsibility. Eventually, Alpine went the cheap route and cut our program officially, with no workload or responsibility decrease (we took calls and assisted other agents as well as supervisor calls). Now, agents get paid a paltry $8, as Alpine needs to keep its costs down so that it may grab new clients. Some were kept on for the program... as in being let ""off phone"", but that was not based on merit, but rather the goody system. If you want to get ahead, you have to brown nose.

The supervisors at the time were not trained to assist us with job related questions, so there were of little help. Some of them I suspected held more than one work at home job (search engine rating) which of course made them very inattentive to agent needs.

I believe the true measure of a company is how well they compensate their people. I consider compensation a combination of pay and benefits. Aside from the low base pay the benefits are the worst I have ever seen in my 20 years of work. Full timers get no paid vacation, horrible health care package that cost more then it pays. If this company offered 1 or 2 weeks paid vacation, I would consider them for a long term career however, in my personal opinion, a company that won't even provide just 1 week paid vacation to their employees is clearly a company that does not value their people.

Low pay and if you want a raise you will be waiting awhile.  No incentive to do better other than getting fired.  Minimum wage according to your province and they keep giving you more and more to do with no kind of salary increase.

You are expected to participate in shift bids and these happen frequently.  So if you signed up for a certain time period that could change.  

Computer systems are horrible and metrics are hard to reach and total focus is on the negative.    This company does not care about the well being of their employees.  It near impossible to get any vacation time booked off in advance and if you do get it approved it can be the day of your vacation.

The training was pathetic to say the least. It was about a month in length. Once you are on the phone. You basically research all your answers in a website.  Extremely time consuming. Once you can not find what you are looking for. You get to ask 'coaches' from 'adobe rooms'. You get to type in your questions and expect answers from them in about a few minutes. Some coaches are helpful. Some are full of attitude. They are usually extremely busy.
They force you to use 'personal time' instead of 'after call work'. They expect you to document all your notes/cases within the call. You do not get paid for being on 'personal time'. 
They send you 5-10 emails daily and you do not have any paid reading time. You have to read them on your own so you can 'catch up'. 
You get extremely unprofessional, harassment emails from your team leader. Here is an example from my team leader sent today :
Team,
I just ask some of you if you're using the script...and this is what I got... 'When did you send it?' Are you all serious?
Let me make it crystal clear. I'm providing you with the tools to do your job and guess what??? You're still not doing it 
Unless someone on the team has 30 million dollars to pay the others salary or to change the policy and procedures they 'like' it... My recommendation to you is that you start using this script and everything will become a lot easier. 
.................................. 
It is all about sales. They expect you to follow the 'script' and bridge( sell) on every single call. Even with irate customers. Which is an expectation that is unreasonable. 
You get to choose a time frame so they suppose to schedule you within the time frame selected. Unfortunately that's Not the case. I was scheduled an hour early on most of my shifts. 
I get paid $10.25/hour during training and $10.50/hour after, no benefits. Technical issues happened on a daily basis.

PARANOID.  They force you to use their SRD (secure remote desktop), which is a virtual OS running over top of your operating system.  This causes problems on a daily basis for half of the agents.

From mid 2010 to the first quarter of 2011, there was lots of opportunity for extra hours and overtime which you could take advantage of frequently.

No real way to communicate effectively communicate with senior management
Capable of being fired in the blink of an eye for a simple mistake or misunderstanding on behalf of management
Very disorganized from all the team leaders all the way up to Senior management
Constantly changing rules that were hard to prepare for
From mid 2011 onwards, they had the most outrageous ways of evaluating the performance of agents. For instance, they had QOS and QA scores. The QA scores were an internal monitoring of a call. The QOS scores were based on a survey filled out by the customer you talked to on the phone. The QOS score process was outrageous. You had to have like 70% be in the top box, or if they were not after a certain amount of weeks even if you were performing well on all of your other metrics, you were put on Corrective Action. This happened to me once and I was very lucky to get out of it. 
Later in 2011, the QA process becomes much more tyrannical and unfair. You could get critical failures on calls for even the slightest of things. It’s like they were trying to find ways to get rid of employees.

However I hung in there throughout the tyrant based QA system dodging some bullets on a few failed calls (perhaps them being disorganized is why I was not written up and thus maybe this time it worked to my advantage and I was lucky to survive some of the onslaughts at this company such as that), until the worst of working for this company came out of the blue in January 2012.
This was by far the worst part of working for this company. In January 2012, they started forcing agents to jump off WITHOUT PAY despite being scheduled only 1 week in advance because the call volume dropped. It got so bad that agents were only getting 10 hours per week, despite being scheduled full time or close to full time 40 hours per week. Sometimes, you would be even lucky to get even 10 hours. And there were other times of very low call volume in the past, and they NEVER, I repeat NEVER forced agents to leave without pay when they were scheduled at least for the program I was scheduled on. The only thing they would do is ask if anyone wanted to leave and they could, but it was never forced. Sometimes during very low call volume, they would force agents off the phones to do training or a team meeting or just hang out in the chat room, but you always got paid, you just had to e-mail your team leader the time off the phones. Then once again out of the blue in January 2012, they started forcing agents to leave without pay despite never giving any advanced warning that they might do this. It was disgusting and unethical and it made me really angry. It was akin to treating us employees like 2nd class citizens. And it also underscored their lack of confidence in the Program I was on (although they would never admit it), because if they had really had confidence in the program going forward, they would have never forced agents to jump off without pay and instead they would have done some type of training or team meetings during times of very low call volume like they did all the time before the past prior to January 2012. That was the case at least for the program I and most of their agents were on. I complained to management and team leaders about it and the only responses I got were excuses saying things such as your schedule is only a guideline and they have to make staffing adjustments. That was such nonsense because it had never happened before during times of low call volume which BTW there were plenty of times. Any company that forces employees to leave without pay despite being scheduled only 1 week in advance is simply a bad company to work for. At the very least, they could have had the decency to warn employees that they may start doing that on the program, but no they just started doing it of the blue as if they thought it was totally ok.  Also, the company grew 54% in 1 year and yet that was how they treated their employees. The company is cash rich and could have easily afforded to not force jump offs without pay given how much money they had and how much they had grown, at least for some time while waiting for the call volume to come back up.  Anyways, I ended up being let go in March 2012 because I complained to management about the forced jump offs without pay.";;Helpful (3);Former Employee - Customer Care Professional;;;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

(which has been super low for almost 2 months and counting)They will tell you it's your system and actually try to proceed like it's indeed your computer that has a problem?? I have a brand new top of the line computer with the fastest internet around that is like up 24/7 and never have a problem until I am loging into Alpine to work.. Oh it's rediculous! They do almost everything possible to save a few bucks here and there.. all of the logging in and out that you have to do when thier programs isn't working properly..Which you don't get paid for... and all the rest of the crap! I mean the meetings that you have to log out in order to attend and then can't see the time you were paid for until after payday.. Alpine Access is Cheating employees out of money earned! I have tried to reach out for help several times and couldn't get as far as a team lead who has been trained to provide canned responses with no solutions! Even when I did email HR, I was redirected to my team lead.

BIG PROBLEMS- They tell you that they have recorded everything right down to the milli-second but that is SO NOT TRUE! If it was recorded as the company suggest then my paycheck would show what my webcam has recorded me working! My house has cameras everywhere so Im always able to go back and check the minutes paid vs the minutes actually worked and SOMETHING HAS BEEN OFF SINCE I STARTED WITH THE COMPANY... It's a new loop every 2 hours.. a loop that explains why they are not paying you for what you should be getting paid for... It seems to me the one thing that the company has perfected is the art of TRICKERY! They paid special attention when they were creating all of these bogus policy's and figuring out the best place to put them where they will be hard to understand and put together in order to beat them at thier own game. 

JUMP OFFS- Oh my goodness... Due to the lack of talent and skills in the management department of the company... They can't afford to keep us and can't afford to let us go.. lol I have top numbers when it comes down to the job, I am a consistent Top Performer, but b/c they have managed to loose the confidence of thier clients... they have also lost the call volume. Every day that  you are scheduled to work there will be a mandatory jump off! Which means ""we can't afford to have you finish your shift"". But they will request that you hang around just incase someone calls and they need you to help out?

NO EFFECIENCY! Between the tools and management and everything in between, you'll be lucky to get 10 hours a week these days.(VERY LUCKY) This is opposed to the 100 hours a week that they tried to force us to work when times were much better for them..Yeah, they fed us bologna about how much we could make with this ambigous document in fine print that you wouldn't understand even if you had a lawyer sitting next to you... Something about if you work from this time to that time and the moon is out and the sky turns a purple-ish color at the same time you will get an extra ten bucks an hour! Then after you somehow thought you met the requirements.. (WRONG) you did not. your team leader is going to explain the crap in a way that is best suited Alpine Access. Not just me here people, I'm telling you this company is FULL OF CRAP. 

BOTTOM LINE- It's funny b/c Im a student and as I am learning more and more about business management, I have come to the conclusion that the people at Alpine Access must have been sleeping in class or maybe even skipped it all together. Just horrible. Companies that try to cheat it's employee's and do not care about doing what is right by the people they expect to perform like rock stars never succeed. Most employee's will grade the company with the performance they provide to it's customers.. When that happens, the entire ship sinks.. Alpine Access..

This was working for wirless company which you need to know all about the data plans,etc,etc.  Half of the time in training, the systems didnt work so we never actually knew if we were making changes and using the systems correctly.  There is alot of time wasted(in my opinion)  on many things that were completely unessesary for the actual job, when more time should have been spent with using the systems and more in depth practice with making the changes that were frequently asked during calls.  Another con is that the chat support usually answers your questions by telling you to look up the information in the program info site.  This was very frustrating and irritaing especially when you first start on the phones and finding information is overwhelming.  The job itself I personally hated but that probably not a company issue.  If you dont like selling much, you wont like this job because it is mostly sales oriented,,they pressure you about sales like 100x a shift, you will get written up if your sales stats are not to par which ive never heard of before.   I have worked in another wirless call centre before and it was NEVER as stats and sales oriented as this place .  They dont seem to care if you are good on the customer service end, if you dont excel at sales, you will hear about it more than once DAILY until it wears you out and you simply want to leave.   The tech issues were terrible, because alot of the times it is their systems that dont work and I was docked alot of time unpaid and its very hard to keep track of all this lost time....and another problem witht he system is that it was TERRIBLY slow and lagged so much you would be on the phone for a good 2 minutes sometimes waiting for a customers account to come up.  I got so sick of the upset callers, lack of being able to really do anything for them, system problems, the less than helpful support  from chat that I really felt I couldnt stand another day.. had to take another job.

- Team Leads have NO idea what they are doing -  When I say this I mean, they know about as little as someone coming off the streets and being your manager. They are only trained in Alpine Access policies and procedures which is a pain 

- Pointless meetings - I can't even tell you how many times I've been in meetings with my Team Lead for 1-2 hrs where I have learned absolutely NOTHING. The only benefit is that it gets you off the phones

- Two words: SHIFT BID - Forced to go through a shift bid on the whole program and only offered 10 different shifts, almost all had split days off (which I'm on now...Fri and Sun off...I mean really?!)

- Lack of coaches during busiest times - Almost consistently you are forced to ask a question 2-3 times before you receive an answer, making them complain about your AHT and how long you have a cx on hold - Just based on the fact that you can spend anywhere from 5-30 min waiting for a simple answer 

- Never receive any stats on performance other than qualities - I have NO idea where I stand in terms of stats. I believe TL's are supposed to send out  reports on how you're doing except it NEVER happens.

- Rogers Policies and Procedures - There are MANY policies on refunds and adjustments that are ridiculous. Rogers will often times admit that it was a mistake on their part but not allow you to credit or adjust a customers bill and of course when you explain this to a customer, they end up wanting to cancel or speak to a supervisor which is EXTREMELY frustrating.

- And the WORST part ? - SALES SALES SALES!! - It seems to be the one and only thing they care about at times. When I was hired, I don't believe I was told that I'd have to make sales but I am in the process of getting in trouble because I haven't had a single one!

I kind of miss being somewhere else for 8-10 hours but believe me it is a minor issue compared to the rest.  

THE COMPANY: This is what I see as the latest version of corporate greed.  That would be Maximum profit for minimum payout.    They silently factor in the fact you are working from home to offset the wage that is paid.  I am sorry but $9.50/hr. is not a living wage.  You have to supply the Office Space, PC, Phone and I had to pay a $45.00 fee for background check.  In addition you are trained for 1 month at minimum wage according to your state.  After training you go to a mid-level where you are on the phones half the time and training the other half.  So you get paid $9.50 for the phone times and minimum wage for the rest.  

THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MICRO-MANAGEMENT: They listen to you all the time.  The watch your logs, your phone times, your off times, your status and then have THREE systems in place for call ratings.  The first is a QA.  This is where an Alpine employee listens in on call.  Then there are QTRIP's where a Microsoft Employee listens in on your call.  Then you have the customer feedback on your interaction with them which gets sorted into top, middle or bottom Box.  These are just a few of the items that factor into your rating or ""weighted"" scores.  Attendance, adherence, time on phone, how long in what status, hold time, the 5 different status's you can be in after a call. Personal time, the three previously mentioned score systems and much more.  

THE ""TRUST YOUR TOOLS LIE:  This is a fast paced environment.  We are told to consult the Visual (or Virtual?) Knowledge Base all the time.  ""Trust your tools"" is thrown around ALOT when you ask questions.  In other words ""look it up”.   The problem is there are conflicting systems in place here.  The ticketing system used is designed by Microsoft.  For anyone that has taken a Microsoft test is already shaking their head.  For the others who haven't that means that common sense and ease of use are beaten and thrown out the window.  For even someone like me that has been in the Tech support field for 18 plus years it is maddening.  What seems like a logical string goes no-where.  What looks like a road block is where you are supposed to go.  It is maddening.  The VKB is a bloated mockery.  I have about 30% success on this when I look up things up using keywords which is all you can look up things by.  This leads me to….

THE CONTRIVED, SENSITIVE AND LOCK STEPPING OVERLORDS: Do not do what I did.  That was asking questions or makes suggestions to improve things and dare to stand up for principals that emphasize humanity that run afoul of corporate policy.  Do not state that there system is clogged with micro-management (and I spoke in corporate when I said that).  That gets you on the radar.  But above all DO NOT show frustration.   See…there is a core group of people who have worked there a long time.  They have faced, accepted and embraced the lower pay, higher responsibilities and ran with it.  They are the types that really scare me.  The ones that say “Hug your customer with your voice on every call”, and “let them hear the smile in your voice”.  Somewhere along the line they shut of reason and humanity and convinced themselves that the pig with a gold ring in its nose was a princess and woe is it to those who disagree.  The anger shown to me is cold (which is really scary) as they hide behind policy, document EVERYTHING and write it down and then send you an email covering what we talked about.  In other words for the less corporate savvy they lay out a long, dry foundation that leads to a firing.  And they have to take that route because though I am resisting the inhumanity this model brings I show up to work and do not go out of my way to get myself in trouble.

You have an Adobe Chat Room that you are supposed to be able to go into and ask for help from people that are there to support you.  These people can be Team Leads, Coaches or SME's (System Matter Experts) - but you're lucky if you get a response within 5 minutes of asking your question.  This may not seem like such a long time but when you have a customer on hold and you are to connect with them every 2-3 minutes to let them know you ""have not forgotten about them"" - that 5 minutes can feel like an eternity!! I can't count how many days there have been multiple support people in the room - you ask a question - it doesn't LOOK like they're busy helping other people because the chat room is empty except for your question - but I've waited upwards of 10 minutes before getting a response! 
in training and in ICU we were given little to no instructions on how to report these issues - when we finally did find out how they wanted this time reported and we started doing it - it was wrong.  Then an email was sent out with the actual policy for reporting tech issues properly if you wanted to get paid.  We were instructed by an Account Manager to re-post any previously issues that were reported incorrectly using the ""new"" system..... so I did.... and heard nothing back from anybody.  Did I email my team lead?  You bet!!  Did I get a reply?  The first time I did - I was told that she would ""look into it""..... then nothing.  I like to think that I am a reasonable person - after all, even though this is my first experience in a call center environment I am no stranger to providing superior customer service as I've been doing it for over 20 years in a MUCH more professional environment that Alpine has or ever will have!  I understand that I'm just one of many people on this person's Team and I know that it takes time to get answers to questions so I gave my Team Leader a good couple of weeks to do her thing and still heard nothing - so, I took it upon myself to prepare an Excel spreadsheet outlining my times that I had tech issues and sent it to her asking that she again look into it.  Did I get a response?  No!!!  And during this time period yet ANOTHER email is sent out from an Account Manager with yet ANOTHER process for reporting technical issues!  I have still heard nothing from my team lead and I've emailed her a third time - I don't even get a courtesy email back saying that it's being looked into!  As of today I am missing more than 11 hours and some of these hours are hours that I was legitimately working but because of their reporting system it shows I did not!!  My Team Leader is/was aware of this and I asked for assistance in getting paid for these hours and guess what??  NO RESPONSE!!  
At one point yet another mass email was sent stating that they had found an error in their system and that agents that were affected would receive retroactive hours on their pay.  It went on to say that these retro hours would be finalized and be reflected in our ""Payroll Summary"" by the end of the day on Wednesday - so...... I checked my summary on Wed. evening.... and I did indeed see some retro hours - 20.25 of them to be exact!!!  Based on the information in the email - I budgeted for that money on my next paycheck..... it was just a fluke that I happened to also check my payroll summary the next day (Thurs) only to find that my retro hours had been reduced from 20.25 to under 2 hours!!!!  That's a big chunk of change for a single mom to loose - especially when it's been budgeted for!!  I sent an email to the Account Manager that had issued the email and asked what had happened.  I was told that they found that their system of ""finding"" the errors was also erroneous!!  This particular Account Manager went on to say that the hours that he & his team had reviewed and APPROVED - were in fact wrong and had been corrected early Thursday morning......If this person is a Manager - and he had already APPROVED the hours PRIOR to them being added to the payroll summary - then the onus should fall on him not us, the employees!!
Oh - and I know you're going to be surprised at this BUT - I received NO REPLY back!!!  LMAO!!

I try to touch on all the pertinent aspects of working here.  I may leave out some things, but I think I’ve at least hit all of the most important subjects.

The Good:

Work from home.  

Mostly decent hours (see: The Bad).  

No commute.  

Friendly Co-Workers.  

Paid Training (see: The Bad).  

Resume Builder.


The Bad:

Some programs have HORRIBLE work hours (overnight, ten hour shifts, etc).  

Very few (if any) full time positions. 

Regularly understaffed (see: The Review)

The (pronounced “thee”) WORST benefits ever (cost more than it pays out). 

Lack of support (see: The Review).

Training is paid at your state's minimum wage

Pay could be better 

Nonstop Tech issues (see: The Review)

No paid time off.";"The Review:

Being able to work from home is nice.  No commute so you save on gas.  No wardrobe to buy.  You can wake up and go to work without even brushing your teeth if you are so inclined.  The people you work with are friendly and willing to answer questions.  You may be able to write off work related expenses.  You have to pay for your background check, buy your equipment, and use your own utilites.  It's worth looking into,  I know I am going to come tax season.

Now for the down side.  It seems as if it is company policy to under staff ALL shifts then beg people to work their scheduled days/hours off (not mandatory/won't look down on you if you don't).  It's really annoying to see that you were scheduled for 24 hrs total for a given work week then see that you've been sent 10 messages asking you to ""jump on"".  The call volume is high and normally back to back.  

In my program, we run at least 7 mandatory programs.  Not to mention the programs you'll used as needed.  This is taxing on your pc.  Programs freeze up constantly.  No matter what they say, they WILL NOT pay you if you have to loli (log in log out) and are no longer logged into whatever phone system is used to track your hours.  

Support is done in a chat room.  On a good day, there are 2 “coaches” or “team leaders” in the room to support the staff working on the given shift.  On most days there is only one.  There are too many people that need help for the small amount of “supervisors” they hire/schedule.  The worst part is that when a caller refuses to take the answers you give them as fact and ask for a supervisor, the people whose job it is to take these calls, avoid it like the plague.   

Training is too short for the amount of information you are expected to learn.  It also skips or glosses over very important aspects to properly fulfill customers’ requests.  You are put on the phones with just enough knowledge to get you by.  When the tough situations arise you are stuck trying to search for information on your own while waiting for the ONE coach in the chat room to either get off the phone or answer the six other people in the chat room that are waiting on help.

Our training class began with 25 people, by the time we went into OJT, there were 18, by the time we hit Production, there were 10.  All jobs have people that don't complete training due to the need to be there everyday without exception.  Emergencies and personal life can make it hard.  BUT, being thrown to the wolves in OJT caused a lot of people to quit.  Within the first two days of OJT, at least four people just didn't show up.  I know that most of the people that quit had no call center experience and weren't ready for the level of BS they would have to put up with from callers that think you are supposed to do whatever they want because they ask. 

Callers are oblivious to the fact that you more than like just answer phones.  For some reason they think YOU are the reason their accounts are screwed.  I don't know how many times I've had to tell people that I don't handle the processing I just field the calls related to it.  You'd think they would realize that they don't have direct numbers to those departments for a reason.  I don't even have a way to call and talk to these departments.  All I can do is send them a request via email and wait for there response.

There is no time allotted for you to do the necessary work needed for some of your calls.  They tell you not to tell people you'll call them back because they'd rather you be taking instead of making calls.  Some calls are not cut and dry.  They want you to make the customers happy and boost their faith in the company, but they don't give you the time or tools to do so.

Breaks are short.  10 minute break and 30 minute lunch is hardly enough down time for such a stressfull job.  You are allowed 4 minutes of Personal Time if needed, but come on let's be serious; It takes that much time to pee and wash your hands.  God forbid you have to go Number Two.

Overall:

It is an excellent resume builder.  I’m sure it depends on which program you are hired for though.  If you can hang on to your sanity for at least a year, the job offers will start rolling in.  There is more responsibility placed upon you than you’d think.  If you can realize this and tailor your resume to reflect it, you have the potential to make yourself a desirable candidate for a number of better, higher paying positions.

I would recommend working here if you’ve

A.	Been out of work for a long time

B.	Are used to call center work and understand how demanding it is

C.	Need to boost your resume

D.	Need the money

Don’t expect to retire from here or be able to meet your financial needs.  This is NOT a career.  It’s a temporary cash flow until you can find something better.  You'll do fine if you've worked in Customer Service or a call center before.";;Helpful (5);CCP;;;;;;Disapproves of CEO;

Being able to chose your schedule is a plus.  The hiring process when very smooth.  The start of training went smooth as well.  I was very excited when I learned I would be working providing customer support for a major gaming provider.  The tech support guy Rex and his team are great.  

My classmates were nice...a lot had extensive gaming backgrounds...so a lot of the information presented was nothing new to them.  

Paid training at your states minimum wage.  Direct deposit.  My pay was correct during the time I was earning minimum wage(training wage).  Benefits that begin at 30 days.";"The training was very outdated.  My trainer spent a ton of time on an area that we don't even take calls for.   Then when we got to billing which is the bulk of the calls she flew through.  I got tired of hearing learn this for the test...but in the real world we do something different.  Lots of technical issues with the applications not working. I got tired of hearing the words ""LOLi""  Meaning log out and back on again.  Most of the time the training adobe room has horrible audio if any audio at all.  Lots of issues with the applications not working.  

My trainer was very clear about her favorites in my training class and pretty much ignored the rest of the class.  They talked a good game about how great each one of is and how important we are to the gaming customer...but its all talk.  When training was finished and the OJT part started it was total chaos.  I had a lot of technical issues and the tech guy and his staff were wonderful.  However because of my technical issues that were not my fault I was not paid.  There is no vacation or paid time off....if you are off the phones for a technical issue you are not paid.  

There are a ton of passwords to keep track of and a ton of acronyms for applications to learn.  They really make it far more complicated than it needs to be.  The time clock is your time on the phones...so if you are off the phones..you have to go through this complicated process if you even hope to get paid. If you do not follow the process to the letter they reject your request.  I was not paid...and gave up.

There really aren't benefits...they are limited coverage discount off medical type benefits. Great if all you need is an annual physical and rarely get sick.  If you get sick you better buy additional coverage on your own.  Sorry but the $450 a year that is covered can be spent just walking into urgent care or an ER. 

The trainer was nice...that is about all I can say about her.  She went on about how important it was to have a professional work environment but her kids were constantly making noise in the background.  She was never able to show us examples because she could never get her system to work.  

Most of the time she was never prepared for class and spent a lot of time trying to get applications and lessons up.  I am sure through the course of the 4 weeks of training she wasted at least 3 days trying to get her systems to work.  The other problem was she took of 4 days out of the training class.  One was for power outage...the other 3 days was because she had training meetings...The sad part is that we got pushed to complete those assignments we missed on those days.

I was promised a call back for an interview and never got it. Called them to schedule and finally got in touch with someone saying they'd get back to me the following week. I was hired and told I'd be given info on training within the next week. I was not contacted for nearly two weeks so I called them again. It seems they lost my background check info and when they found it they forgot to contact me about setting up a training schedule. (Keep in mind I had already spend over $100 on phone equipment since it had to be on my desk by the start of training.) 

Training was done at my state's minimum wage and took over a month to complete. My trainer was competent but the systems we were to use and the information we were given was out of date not to mention the fact we were unable to train for billing which is what 90% of our calls were on. Once I started taking live calls the communication ceased almost entirely. I had 4 different bosses in 6 months and never knew who to report to and every time I had to report anything such as missed time worked (I shall get to the technical issues in more detail later) it needed to be reported in at least three different places, none of which were easy to find on their webpage. We were placed on the phones after 2 weeks of our month long training due to high call volume for a product launch with no way to handle the issues that came up. 

If we were unable to work our shift due to a problem with one of the company's systems we were told we'd be paid but this turned out to be a flat out LIE because in reality all technical issues caused by Alpine's systems were unpaid and we were still expected to work on getting them resolved.  I started my shift PROMPTLY at the assigned starting time, ended exactly at the ending time and took all of my breaks and lunch EXACTLY on time yet some how lost at least 10 minutes every day from my pay as even being gone one second past when you're supposed to be back docks you 2.5 minutes and to be honest, when I have to use the bathroom I can't always time it perfectly! 

Finally the ultimate communications breakdown occurred just before the end of my employment. I had been promised a 1 on 1 coaching and improvement session before I completed training. Nearly 8 months later I had not received any 1 on 1 time with any of my 4 different bosses when I was finally called aside by my boss... to be informed my performance wasn't good enough so I was being let go. That's right, the first feedback I EVER received in 8 months on the job was a layoff notice. I was told I'd work two more weeks to see if I could find a job internally. The next time I tried to log in for work I was locked out of the company system. I reported this to tech support who said they'd work on it and that was the last I ever heard from this company.";;Helpful (5);XBox Support;;;;;;;Doesn't Recommend

You're marked down on QA if you don't resolve the call even if the customer can't pass the security verification and you are REQUIRED to end the call w/o providing them account information.

Room for advancement is there...but you're competing with 300 of your closest coworkers for the same position so good luck with that!

Call are non-stop so don't you dare step away from your computer when you're working. Lunch is only 30 minutes so unless you've premade something or have a spouse to cook for you....you MIGHT have time to eat it.

Benefits are just about non-existent and the ones they do offer are pretty terrible at best.

And the latest and greatest is that in addition to being evaluated based on our QA scores, but that we'll also be evaluated on customer satisfaction surveys and attendance. You can be a fabulous agent and have to give someone bad news (ie: past due balance, not being able to provide acct information due to security verification) which pisses off the customer and they score you as a 1 on their evaluation. And then you're penalized for it. I understand completely being evaluated on attendance, but what do you expect when you're paying someone just shy of minimum wage?

The Xbox program is open every single day of the year so if you happen to be scheduled for a holiday you can be sure you're working it.

Systems kept failing making it impossible to complete training assignments, expectation was that they should be completed on personal time without pay if you were to succeed.  Much of the training material was out of date and inaccurate, the trainers were not properly trained and had no support to provide solutions to the problems.  Prior to the end of the training employees are expected to take customer calls if the call volume is high without proper support.  If you question or complain you are told to just wing it, be polite and eventually you will learn how to do your job.  Alpine states that they expect great customer service but fails to provide the tools to deliver customer service and doesn't seem to care.  About half the class resigned when forced to handle customer calls without having proper training, the trainers said that this is about normal for most training classes.

1. A HUGE deal was made about going IPO, which served the interests of the board and the Executive team...but no one else. They love to talk about how successful it was, as if waving it in our face that they made out like bandits, while the rest of us got NOTHING out of it. Very few but the highest levels received stock options, an they never rolled-out an employee stock purchase plan. They know how greedy they appear...they simply do not care.
2. The company became a leader after transforming/reinventing itself; but those days are gone. Within a few more quarters the analysts will realize there is nothing new under the hood after all the roadmap promises and the competition will catch up. This is exactly what happens when you forget that employees are your biggest asset.
3. Innovation has been replaced by micromanagement across all departments. There is no more room for creativity in design or format, since all the managers care to do is impress the person above them. We used to function in ""virtual teams"" that respected each other...those days have been replaced by overworked, unhappy ""worker bees"" who just want to finish the work on their plate and not be bothered by any requests outside their management structure. 

Make no mistake, this WAS a great company once upon a time. The positives and good stories you may have heard were most likely true. But unless you are a very ""heads down"" person who can follow orders without feeling the need to improve on processes or question anything, this is absolutely not the place for you, and it's exactly why I left.";;Helpful (7);Former Employee - Web Developer;in Waltham, MA;Waltham, MA;;;;;Doesn't Recommend

Unfortunately, most of those people eventually end up leaving because of all the Cons listed below.  Have a Silkwood shower after dealing with anyone over there.;"1. Wasteful management of time, resources, (LOTS of) money, and employee cycles/productivity to cover their poor business management choices overall.
2.  Burning out their team resources left and right and not giving a damn - with zero thought to continuity management, let alone having to 100% redo projects due to the lack of understanding or whim of whomever holds the magic totem pole for the week/quarter/year.
3. Blatant harassment and/or horrific management styles ignored by HR (or worse, condoned by HR).  Very fratboy-centric behavior and allowed comments at management or above level (think of the derogatory terms that start with the letters B, C, and S - all used for woman typically - being used in open forums or meetings).
4. Let's call a spot a spot - the obvious ""pay for play""/fake Glassdoor reviews done by a HR team or their lackeys under false credentials to boost the scores of the company and CEO (check the older listings - not so rosy or ""perky!"" in their descriptions).
5.  Moving HQ to a new building to simply gain signage rights against I-95 corridor for the sake of the ego of the management team.
6. If they are so ""transparent"", ask them to publish their employee attrition rates.  WAY higher than average software companies.
7. Non-competitive pay packages with zero ability to have a growth plan in career development.
8.  No pay increases - they instead rely on AMEX/VISA gift cards to ""reward"" their employees. 
9.   Middle management has their lips pursed 24/7 on their boss's butt - zero management/guidance of how to groom their own people to gain skill sets, be better employees, work more collaboratively.
10.  Get JVS and Bernd out of the way and maybe the absence of their egos will 
correct the company - it is a constant ""kiss the ring"" mentality with each of them.";;Helpful (7);Former Employee - Analyst;;;;;;;Doesn't Recommend

Leadership support is fantastic. If they see you working hard and putting in your all you are recognized. Working hard and pulling your all doesn't mean a lot of hours but being excited and getting things done. 
*Not restricted to just your job description or title. If you have an interest in and/or want to get involved in another area it is supported and even encouraged. It's great as you won't get bored and it helps you have the bigger picture and build great rapport with others when you are doing your primary duties. 
*Support of work-life balance. If you do have a time period where you work more hours then ""normal"" it is recognized and you are encouraged to balance that as soon as you can as they don't want you to burn yourself out. 
*Virtual work offices are permitted for most positions. There are some exceptions but most folks realize what those positions are and why that would be the case. 
*No micromanaging as far as if you are getting your work taken care of and responsive no one is going to watch every moment of where you are and what you are doing. The only exception I would expect we may have to this is if you are a role that requires covering support for specific hours.";"*With a decent amount of virtual staff it can be a challenge to build rapport but with the continued move to the right tools and continued support and development on how to increase interaction it is continuously improving

The culture is far from the corporate culture you may be accustomed to and more a fresh and relaxed culture with frequent company events that promote bonding with coworkers and sometimes these events are based around tech like our innovation days.

We really are high-tech, always on top of new technology as our Product Managers keep our software fresh with integration into latest technologies.  

Career growth is something you can achieve yourself. With hard work and determination, you can drive your career within the company by advancing to new positions or taking on new responsibilities where there is a need.  Over the many years I've worked here, I've led many new initiatives while holding the same job title, so your title doesn't really need to change to expand your career.

If you have the drive to grow, you'll help the company as well as yourself, and with our quarterly Employee of the Quarter initiative you'll definitely be recognized for your efforts!

If certification is of interest to you, you can be recognized in the industry by achieving one or more of our Dynatrace certifications.  If you succeed at the Associate certification, go for the challenging Dynatrace Pro certification and become recognized as a Pro in your field.

The CEO, while busy, is generally approachable and cares about his employees, and has his head on straight when it comes to knowing what’s real and what matters.

- Benefits are on par with what other companies are offering.

- Flexible hours.

- Leadership is generally open to working remote.

- People are generally friendly, and there is an atmosphere of cooperation and collaboration, rather than competition.

- Good office culture both in Detroit and in Boston.

- Results-oriented management; if you meet your expectations, then management is very flexible.

- Management has successfully navigated a series of acquisitions and splits to grow a fantastic organization.

- Company recognizes operational difficulties and takes steps to correct them, even if they’re a little slow about it.

- Objectively excellent product, made by geniuses who focus on streamlining the user experience";"- Very easy to become disconnected if you are full-time remote. This can lead to interpersonal conflicts, which are made more difficult since you aren’t there in person to handle them.

- Heavy focus on global user conference can be something of a distraction, and if you aren’t directly involved, can make you feel excluded.

- A couple years ago, DT shifted from giving regular performance reviews to giving reviews ad hoc. This was marketed to employees as a means by which managers would be empowered to give raises more frequently, based on employee merit. In practice, it has meant fewer performance reviews and fewer opportunities for raises, which are often smaller than what they could/should have been.

- Largely due to the above, pay is NOT competitive, and does not track with professional improvement (or even inflation), especially over time.

- Company is undergoing a digital transformation, but is still hesitant to fully commit to the best solutions, or let non-core applications experiment with new technologies and methodologies and figure out how to do it best.

- Memories of past layoffs make asking for raises or coverage for standard business expenses (i.e. traveling to the office) very anxious experiences.

- Efforts to unify the messaging have given some teams considerably more leverage in the organization than others.

- Marketing team likes to completely rebrand every 18 months, which damages brand consistency, and has a ripple effect throughout the organization with arbitrary requirements and timelines that are foisted upon other teams without consulting them, often with a sense of urgency that distracts from other projects.

- Not really a con so much as something to consider: the company has a tendency to try and monetize things, which can make some applications stray from their original goal and business purpose.";;Helpful (4);;;;;;;;

The PDP program was a very exciting time and I made some great lifelong friends in addition to co-workers. Dynatrace's software is amazing and I have yet to see a more complete solution in the industry. I've been on client sites where we were displacing two different competing products and got to work with said products in order to see what they liked about them and then quickly duplicated and ""one upped"" it using the Dynatrace solution.";"I was hired in at 55k and told that the median increase in salary was 50% and that there were yearly bonuses once in the field. Before I ever got to the field bonuses we're eliminated as mandated by the private equity firm that now owns Dynatrace (Thoma Brovo). Also after almost two and a half years that 50% increase still looks like a far off goal despite having outstanding performance reviews. When asking what needs to be done to obtain the salary amount increases I was told during my hiring process and during PDP training there is never a clear, structured, measured way of saying that if you do xyz then you have done what is needed. 

I was also hired and promised these things after they were aquired by TB so I find it hard to not feel bait and switched. Like a previous reviewer has stated, they don't seem to care at all for employees when they displace you to go to another client. They will say the relocation limit for moving is 2k but you can get a little more (+500) with with an obsurd amount of persistence. Also make sure you have a relocation fund since they make you relo out of pocket even though everyone has a corporate Amex card. 

Another thing to consider is that contracts are usually done in six to twelve month chunks. This means you have to find a place to live and either go for a shorter more expensive lease or risk having to break a year lease if the six month contract does not renew. You won't be compensated for any financial penalties of breaking your lease since they group that into your already absurdly low relocation budget. Furthermore, you will likely be paying month to month after a twelve month contract while they figure out your next engagement. This means no matter what the situation is, you will be paying more in rent overall just for having the privilege of working for Dynatrace.";;Helpful (4);Current Employee - Anonymous Employee;in Detroit, MI;Detroit, MI;;;;;Doesn't Recommend

It also offers market-leading training on its products and general practices. Middle management and team cohesion can be one of the most rewarding aspects of the job. Talent is phenomenal with great expertise, collaboration, and enthusiasm.

The training program for fresh college graduates is an excellent introduction to the working world for those that don't have it, though they oversell what they're able to teach you. Don't expect to learn to write code if you don't already know how to, for example.";"Sales, product, and services are not often very aligned. This can lead to mismatches in messaging (both internal and external) and strategic direction. Sales over promises and over commits and services are generally left to pick up the pieces. This can lead to considerable frustration.

The team in Austria writes most of the software and there is a considerable organisational disconnect between the EMEA and NORAM teams. There is also a perception that PE ownership of the company is driving upper management to make short-term decisions that maximize our short-term value but put our long-term viability at risk. This is just a perception and I'm not sure how true this is.

The interview communicated a different role and different company than I ended up working with. Additionally, many of the support systems  that were supposed to be in place for employees were virtually non-existent after the professional development program (PDP). During the interview they stated that each employee would have an individual career development plan and this would allow for rapid advancement within the company. They also overstated that their aggressive performance-based compensation program. Finally, they failed to communicate the pace and frequency of relocation.

Many employees were surprised to discover that the actual compensation after two years employment was considerably lower than what was communicated as median after that same time. This has led to a  higher than normal churn rate and overall unhappiness among most of my peers. There is a general distrust of management and lot of grumbling as a result. This obviously can become a somewhat toxic environment. More senior consultants report that there is little career growth and a few have communicated  that they haven't had a performance review in nearly two years. Compensation does not match cost of living and nearly all COLAs are rejected. Those that are accepted are considerably below market and disconnected from Dynatrace's peers. Consultants in these high cost markets are either of low quality, limited experience, or limited tenure almost universally.

Relocation preferences are quite hit-or-miss. They are incredibly dependent on luck and availability,  and contract length can vary widely. While there are some internal changes to affect the length of contracts, there have been some consultants that were asked to move locations 4-6 months apart with less than two weeks notice and with a fixed relocation budget that's not related to distance or circumstances.";;Helpful (2);Current Employee - Anonymous Employee;;;;;;;Doesn't Recommend

Competitive for new members of the workforce. Right out of college, this company has good pay and lots of opportunity for quick raises if customers like you. Performance appraisals are every 6 mos. and there is usually a base pay increase associated with it (varies based on your performance obviously). I started out at $55k and 3 years later am making ~$40k more than that, as a 25 year old. Most of my friends make nothing close to that yet.

Valuable experience with market-leading products. You get a lot of experience with good software that is updated and innovated frequently, and this translates into job offers. I usually get LinkedIn job offers once every month or two. I'm not saying this as a Dynatrace fanboy either (see below); I genuinely think the products offered are good and useful, and the experience is valuable.

Lots of independence. As a Guardian, you'll often be placed at a customer and only talk to your boss back at Dynatrace once a week (after a period of getting you settled in and ramped up). Lots of freedom to take the reins and steer customer adoption and use of the products you are delivering (and that is encouraged).";"Company views you as expendable, treats you like crap. Has no consideration for your well-being whatsoever.

Let's face it. Dynatrace has a very good HR program that recruits right out of college. I had my first contact with Dynatrace in speed interviews as a sophomore, almost 3 years before I was actually hired. This is great for Dynatrace, but it means that they have a constantly renewing source of cheap labor, so they don't really have to worry about keeping existing Guardians happy.

Example: they will ask you for preferences on where in the country you would like to work, then ignore them completely for years. Dynatrace has moved me twice in the past 3 years, and both times it was to other states across the country on less than 2 weeks' notice. The second time they forced the move even after I specifically told them I did not want to move. Their relocation program only reimburses up to $2k in most cases, which is not enough to pay to move an apartment across the country, especially if you want to use a moving company. If you don't get your expense report itemized and submitted before the 20th of the month, they don't reimburse you until the end of month paycheck the following month (so about 40 days later). As a direct result of the last forced move, I went into $5,600 of credit card debt, only $4,000 of which of which will eventually be reimbursed, I was forced to take out a $1,500 cash advance on a credit card to pay for a cashiers check for my first month's rent in the new apartment, and my credit score dropped by 49 points because of the sustained high debt to credit ratio.

Basically, when you are at a customer environment, the Guardian position can be pretty cool. The professional development program gets you a lot of experience and a lot of valuable expertise very quickly. But every time I switch contracts, I am reminded that the company really doesn't give a crap about me as an employee; they only care about me because a client is paying X amount of money for me to be somewhere.

Also, your value quickly outpaces your pay. I don't have any hard numbers to back this up, but in my talks to various companies, my sense was that most companies would be willing to pay more than $100k for experienced Dynatrace consultants just to cut out Dynatrace as the middleman and get cheaper professional services, but my pay at Dynatrace has not matched that.

Dynatrace is a very ethical company.  We have hired a number of reps, and our customers tell us that some of our competitors cannot say the same.  We have good people, good leaders, and we do the right things.  The focus is always on the customers success.

Product Quality and Innovation:  We don't lose when we go head to head.  There is a reason that Dynatrace has been the market leader and highest rated product by the leading analyst firms for the last 6 years.   If you are going to join a company in APM, the other players don't even come close to our coverage, footprint, and rate of innovation.

Work life balance:  We are mainly virtual, so that is either a positive or a negative. I miss having an office once in a while, but I think most people on my team like working from home.   Dynatrace from a sales perspective is a very good place to be.  People can make a lot of money here, and the culture is one that holds you accountable, but does not put unreasonable pressure on you.

They expect you to face customers for 8h per day and then spend 2-3h to reply to emails, follow-up on previous engagements, participate to forums, get trained on new versions of the products, pass product certifications... This could be acceptable if there was some counterpart to this but the best thing you'll get is often a pat on the back.

- Recently, overall product quality in AppMon dropped as most of the senior developers were working on Ruxit/Dynatrace. This lead to very uncomfortable situations for customer-facing employees where we were not able to deliver on customers' expectations. Looks  like management realized their mistake but it'll take a few months before we get back to a satisfying level (in the meantime, competition is not wasting time).

- New features/enhancement requests process is ridiculous and product management always knows better than anyone else and will rarely listen to different opinions. While it is true they came up with great ideas, there are also numerous examples of bad choices.

- Mediocrity is rewarded: I have seen many cases where unproductive managers were promoted to higher positions only because they were able to provide reports that the micro-managing nature of their higher-ups required. These managers were usually not able to shield the employees from the pressure coming from above and this lead to cases where employees would lose half a day every week (often while on customer site) writing reports even if there wasn't anything new to mention.

The company has great products and services. My management asks for and listens to opinions. At least some other departments are the same. People are willing to help each other and really care about what happens to both coworkers and company. My team is great - good, very talented people. Everyone really cares about doing the right thing and most upper management seems to as well.;The biggest issues here are transparency, communication, clarity and consistency. There is a very top-down atmosphere set by the CEO. Monthly presentations are not 'town halls' where people can ask questions - it's one way. Consequently many employees don't feel the need to attend - they'll just watch the recording. There was a recent layoff with no communication afterwards about why or what it might mean to those still standing. This immediately after closing 'another record quarter'. Good people are looking and everyone is scared. There's a very real sense that Linz is actually in charge and running the company. Unless you work in Linz, you're not valued or safe. The Linz team appears to do what they want and all budget/hiring flows to the new software they've developed while the rest of the company cuts and lays off (see above). The reasoning behind this is never explained so it feels like the tail wagging the dog – especially given the stated ‘3-4 year window’ for our current owners to sell the company. It has been very demoralizing to the rest of the organization. Motivation and commitment are gone and morale is extremely low while pressure to perform and work harder are at an all-time high. There is a profound sense of unfairness, arbitrariness and arrogant executive leadership. Whether or not all of this is actually true, in the absence of real and open communication, perception is reality. This is a VERY REAL core culture problem. Leadership is viewed as hypocritical giving 'culture awards' in this environment. CEO is seen as simultaneously weak/indecisive and a bully.;;Helpful (19);Current Employee - Anonymous Employee;;;;;;;Doesn't Recommend

In any other environment collaboration and success would thrive!;"Don't let the good reviews fool you, they're written to promote the company directed by management. I have NEVER known a single employee (current or former) that has anything positive to say about the company. 

Bottom line is that this company hires new talent, squeezes them dry of their potential and ideas, chews them up and spits them out.  

If you work at DynaTrace be ready to walk on eggshells because mass layoffs are common and the turnover rate is incredibly high. Working at DynaTrace for 1.5 years I had 5 managers - most of which were forced to ""resign"". 

Management does not care about their employees and the feeling of under-appreciation and uncertainty of the company, your position, and your future is always present. Do not expect your ideas or time to be valued. If you want to be the type of employee to work 60+ hours regularly, not have an opinion, put your head down and say ""yes sir"" - this is may be the place for you.

Do not expect to be promoted because that is impossible in this company. They only higher management from external sources. The politics at this company are heart retching and sick. So all I can say to those who dismiss my warning and accept a job at DynaTrace, watch your back. You are replaceable and that is beat that management drums to.

It has been a year since I have worked at DynaTrace (formerly known as Compuware APM) and I still have not recovered from the emotional abuse of working at this company. I am not writing this review as a disgruntled employee, but as an attempt to prevent you from working DynaTrace. They beat my soul and confidence down and it still haunts me.

Their experience might have been caused by decisions rooted during the Compuware tenure, not by the old or new Dynatrace. At least that's what I have seen often.

There really are no pros. Unless you are strapped for cash or have no previous job experience, look for an actual job that will build your career.";"The management. Their only interest is saving face, and protecting themselves from their superiors. The departments are run like a popularity contest. Promotions are not given on a merit basis. They make you take some stupid tests to get a promotion. First promotion you receive is larger than the second promotion. How does that even make sense? Shouldn't promotions increase as you stay with a company? That's just part of the backwards logic this company has. Don't trust your managers, they will burn you.
Monotonous work. Mounting pressures. High turn around rate, and responsibilities are often redistributed to everyone when someone leaves. Company thinks everyone is replaceable and when they can't replace someone their solution is to just redistribute the work to someone else, while not increasing the salary to match added responsibilities. Oh, and if you think this redistribution of responsibilities is temporary you are sorely mistaken.
Skills don't transfer over in the professional Finance/Investment world. Most of the policies Gain Capital uses are archaic. They don't provide enough in-house training, and education. The longer you work here the more behind you are in building your career. Do yourself a favor and earn your chops, work a year, and run for the hills. You’ll learn a lot more in a month working for a bigger company than you will learn here in a whole year.
Poor incentives and bonus structure. At first you think that oh jeans, awesome! Oh free bagels on Friday awesome! Oh free coffee! Even better. However, none of these things help repair a toxic corporate culture.

One particular (Without mentioning names) has free reign to Bully, intimidate, use threats of firing (Scare tactics), Abuse absolutely everyone behind their back and has direct access to all staff members. Due to this they force workload onto people without any regards for triage and some of the work they force upon them has unreasonable deadlines, is poorly managed and only half of the information is passed on. Already set up for a fall before you begin and then when it goes wrong the entirety of the blame fulls on the unfortunate person who was given the task rather than with the person who poorly handed it down. You are then rewarded by more abuse, shouting and swearing usually with an audience to better their effect !
Whilst this goes on, all other senior management will just turn a blind eye to it (Even those senior to them) and for this reason I think they are just as bad.

Due to this person, I (As well as anyone else I have spoken to about this) truly believes that they are the main reason why GC has not progressed and why it will continue to fail in the future.

After the global economic crisis strongly hit Headstrong, the company had to dilute its focus to hedge its risks. Since the focus is diluted, the rates charged to the clients had to be reduced too (along with Clients' themselves going through budget cuts). With this, the only way to realize profits was to cut costs, leading to employee dissatisfaction.
Headstrong is still a great place to meet like minded Technology specialists and folks with strong Capital Markets business knowledge.";Due to the acquisition by Genpact, and the subsequent loss of erstwhile management, focus on IT in general has gone down. Due to the existing loss of bargaining position and a higher focus on profitability, especially through cost cuts, Headstrong is neither able to nurture, nor retain the talent.

Compensation given is below the market standards and when the resource leaves then they arrange for the new resource with more CTC than the one who left .. Why cant you just pay your current employee..

Highly incompetent people at middle management,whose job is nothing but to do office politics and get up in the hierarchy not by doing good work but by doing flattery and being nice to their seniors.They are technically weak  who just love to have credit with them and blame is given to juniors in case of failures.
Favoritisim and sycophancy plays major role in promotion.

There are no doubt very few smart people are still here left out.

Lacks fairness,Good work is not rewarded unless you have good chemistry with managers.The irony is that each time our centre head talks high about the the fairness in the company in common gathering,which is just not existing anywhere.

Processes[DAG] sucks,40% of team man hours goes in just filling datas in irrelevant excel sheets ,and in the end employee has to stretch his hours to make it up for development.

Interview process is no longer stringent and thus its quite easy to clear the rounds now.People with very minimal knowledge and analytical ability are getting through and bringing down the quality of code and thus brand name of company.All good and intelligent guys are slowly leaving company and anyone thus go and takes interview ,that brings in less competent candidate in the company.
Earlier it used to recruit freshers from IIT/NIT now they go for any b-grade colleges for recruitment.The idea is to cut cost as much as possible by any means.This company is loosing its past sheen with each passing day as all the smart and intelligent people are leaving company.

Even with profits and economic boom,cost cutting is going on.No dustbin,sharing phones,open space,no privacy,no mineral water ,no snacks and eatables in pantry..just everything is gone.

The regional managers celebrate everything.  Training is engaging, informative, and fun.  The people can be very warm.;"This warmness in the office environment only exists if you ""fit in"".  As previous reviews have discussed, it is about how you look at this company.  I knew my particular office was a bit religious but it didn't really bother me.  I enjoyed the work.  I liked helping people find work (although it was temporary).  The problem with the company is how they practice discrimination.  I understand companies (clients) had certain criteria (also discriminatory).  We would have to place people in positions based on race, sex, appearance, and language.  There were code words used in the office such as heavies (men) or lights (women).  Instead of just looking at a persons experience in their application, we would have to scroll down and look at their I-9 forms to see what they ""looked like"" on their photo i.d.  If they looked questionable, we would bring them in to basically check them out in person.  If they listed too much experience on their application they were pretty much ""unable to be placed"" due to their age.  The religious practices in the office was a little much but I didn't speak out.  My regional manager insisted on group prayers constantly. 

Another problematic, systematic problem is their failure to make clear to the temp employees they sign on to what the charges are going to be.  Employees don't realize they are going to be charged for background checks, id badges, etc.  They do this anually also without making that clear to employees.  I tried to tell employees this and was told not to.  Legally, it is in the fine print of some of the forms they sign when they apply.  Deceptive.  They also will knowingly have potential temp employees show up at work site, knowing that at least some of them will be sent home unable to work because they overcompensate for ""no-shows"".  And the payroll system for many of these temps is  a mess.  Instead of allowing employees to pick them up at office, if needed, they mail them out so it is days, if ever, that they get them.  And if the check is wrong (as if often the case), employees have to continually fight for weeks to get paid correctly.  This happened over and over again in my time there.

While bonus potential is good the structure of the program is unfair.  Employees are supposedly paid monthly and quarterly based on the work they have done and the profit goals but someone who generates 65% or more of the revenue and Profit for the branch could be paid the same amount of bonus as a person who is not even making the bare minimum of effort to reach their branch financial goals.

-Brand recognition and resume builder";"At its early years, Kayak was blessed by the results of its initial strategy in the US, leading to its IPO and acquisition by the Priceline group. Now, the company finds itself still recovering from a hangover that was the re org of its global commercial team, 2 years a go. Coupled with a few mismanaged acquisitions (Momondo/Cheapflights) and a merger with Open Table, the company is primed for a tough road ahead. Competitors like Google Flights and Skyscanner caught up and outpace Kayak on product and as a performance channel for its partners. 

The global commercial team is small for the revenue it brings which leads to saturated titles and even bigger egos. The leadership team often chooses to fight internal battles to leverage or protect their own growth rather than welcoming different points of views, or simply executing on ideas that will help the business as a whole. This results in a clicky and toxic environment where result-driven work falls flat, because in the end it was all a fake meritocracy where ""who you are close to"" becomes the true success currency.

Recently, there were attempts to improve the culture and internal process, but these efforts lacked authenticity, and ultimately, rewarded the very same leaders who turned a blind eye to the issues prior.";;Helpful (25);Current Employee - Commercial;;;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

Ultra-cliquey 
The culture is very junior.
Your only metric for success is how much money you make for Priceline.  Regardless of what they tell you in the interview  - you will NOT be revolutionizing the travel industry.  You will however be a slave to A/B testing that is set up by people with no testing expertise, only spreadsheets and profit reporting.  Yet they pretend to be a wonderful holistic startup full of wonderful values.  If you buy their HR fluff, then go ahead and join their cult.  If you want to add real value for CUSTOMERS (not Priceline necessarily) then look elsewhere.
Sure nearly everyone is nice, but they are almost never considerate, thorough or even competent.  
Will your manager tell you when they are going on vacation?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  
Will your coworkers stop pretending they are good at your job too and hoarding work because it makes themselves feel more important?  Maybe, maybe not.  
Will your manager be clear with you about what they expect and when?  Maybe.
Will your manager have a deep knowledge of your role and the skills involved?  Probably not.  Will they pave the way for your success rather than theirs?  Are you kidding me?.
Instead you will be put through a series of 2 minute meetings that add up to nothing you can act on.  They like to rush around like they are super busy, but all that happens is everyone is interrupting everyone else so frequently that barely any work gets done at all.

- generous snacks and social events
- offices are quiet and allow a focused workflow
- because everybody works and is productive, there's a great buzz in the air
- generous allowance when traveling on company expense";"- if you've been hired externally, you're not allowed to settle into the company or learn how their processes work. Kayak has its own software and internal programs, it is expected of you to know the ins and outs of the company ideally from your second day onwards. After 3 months you should be best buddy with everyone and have acquired the expertise of someone who's done the job for 6+ years
- Colleagues are fake and will throw you under the bus at any given opportunity. Unfortunately, most don't understand the concept of trust and can't communicate effectively. e.g. if there's a problem they will lie straight into your face that everything is ok, but they will ambush and bad mouth you to your manager. On the one hand, they want you all to be best friends and a ""family"" (I don't need another one, I already have a family!) but as soon as you think you're building meaningful relationships, you're backstabbed. 
- Kayak doesn't like change hence why only a handful of selected core employees are allowed to stay. The rest is Hire and Fire
- a lot of very young inexperienced people with big job titles and no actual manager responsibilities
- Hire and Fire. Kayak is well known for this shady and highly questionable practice, a lot of talented people out there avoid Kayak and Recruiters don't want to work with the company anymore
- No one is safe. You can do an amazing job, receive outstanding praise and the next thing you know you get fired for no reason (or the most pettiest reason). Redundancy is unfortunate, but at least be fair and give people honest feedback and a chance in the form of an improvement plan. 
- Once fired they will treat you like a criminal including post shaming at its finest. Not sure if this is how you want to treat former employees as word spreads fast in the industry and I can see clients being put off by this.
- American Company with zero understanding of European culture. US Employment at will (fire at any given moment without reason) does not exist in Europe
- Very aggressive towards introverted employees and no drink shaming. Extroverted employees who binge drink and come to work drunk after a Social are celebrated as heroes
- ALL work Socials are binge drinking sessions 
- a lot of boring, pointless and unnecessary meetings in which 50% of the time is wasted on repeated conversations what has already been said over and over discussing aspects but not moving forward. Kayak people love to hear themselves talk, even if agenda of the meeting was clear and fully understood they insist you ""say something"" and repeat back like a 5-year-old that everything was understood. Doesn't matter what you say even if it's not relevant or productive
- Managers don't practice what they preach, hence why mega fake and pretentious. Lead as an example!
- No team structure. Manager is ""too busy"" to do their actual managing responsibilities, team is too junior and if there is a senior member they are most likely stacked with too much work so you're constantly left by yourself figuring things out (esp dangerous in the onboarding stage)
- Employees are played against each other by senior management. Threats to not receive promotions, pressure and intrigues
- the workload is insane for the little pay they offer
- Employees who chat all day are favoured to those who work and want to remain professional 
- extreme interference in your personal life and lifestyle   
- You don't even get an exit interview
- the company is not interested in keeping positive relations to former employees, they rather waste money for further recruiting and new hires which will be fired after 3 months 
- career opportunities only to those who've worked there for two years and win a competition, so if you're not backstabbing, binge drinking or prepared for other controversial practices you have no future at this company";;Helpful (14);Former Employee - Anonymous Employee;in London, England;London, England;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

I think the “ground force” and the partners, not the management, is what will make you appreciate this company. These friendships and network is one of the things you can take away. They are the ones that make you enjoy coming to the office and having a good journey in the short-medium term.

There are also nice perks such as monthly social events, massages, some snacks and drinks which make it nice for fraternizing but also help pulling longer hours at the office.";"Let´s start by saying that KAYAK is an American company with an American culture and that it has grown extremely fast, from no more than 400 in 2015 to over 2,000 employees these days. Main cons I experience:

1. In my opinion, the biggest problem this company has is that it´s grown too fast for its own sake. The infrastructure, this is: People, Systems and Culture, was not ready to resist the influx of company acquisitions and here I believe that leadership is to blame for not building the foundation.

2. They thought the mantra they have, ¨part cowboys¨, would sustain a growing complex global business, when in fact they needed to PLAN ahead. One of the biggest cons I see in this company is the lack of people at the top having the ability to build mid-long term strategies, a master plan and processes to deliver sustainable growth. I reckon we are in a fast moving industry, but unfortunately employees and partners need to buy into a vision and a strategy which you haven´t been able to set firmly. This has resulted in not so positive company results and a lot of the firing/sacking you have read from other negative comments on this page. There´s been redundancies among the different workforces, KAYAK and new brands acquired.

3. Providing a career path, competitive salaries or visibility and alignment between roles and functions is not their forte. This means that there are known compensation gaps; you do not know what are the career options in your foreseeable future or that nobody can explain how people hold director and above titles not having sufficient experience or know how. Let´s put it this way, HR is an ongoing chaos and do a disappointing work. 

4. The partners, those who pay for the company services, have long noticed and remind: KAYAK is busy dealing with itself. This is normally driven by regular restructuring and lack of maintaining a sustainable business to provide a win-win situation to all stakeholders.

5. Firing, it´s a business and the company is entitled? Yes, BUT they do not consider the repercussions it has to the business partners and to the morale. Imagine being asked from one day to the other to leave not being able to say goodbye to clients or people whom you´ve worked with. What´s the image when a partner asks about a project you worked and colleagues know nothing or when a peer needs to deliver double the work to cover for those fired? These are dangerous grounds as not only KAYAK is demotivating its workforce but it´s hurting the hand that feeds it.

6. No commitment to any humanitarian or environmental issues. In today´s society, young generations consider companies that show actively their commitment to some of today´s issues, KAYAK does not stand by any of these nor has a CSR programme in the making.

7.  Lastly, The simple fact that the positive reviews (4 and 5 stars) in this KAYAK page probably come from the fact that HR asks employees to write something good is disappointing. The quality of those reviews, please notice the 1 liners, will not help the reader to have an idea of the company and challenge the very existence of Glassdoor.";;Helpful (19);Current Employee - Anonymous Employee;;;;;Negative Outlook;Disapproves of CEO;Doesn't Recommend

Little-to-no personal accountability.  No one will ever ask you your opinion, or to exercise critical thinking, or to step out of your comfort zone. The development tools and infrastructure are so awfully slow that you have plenty of time to goof around, eat snacks, pick up a new hobby, all while waiting for your local environment to boot up.

These points are of course actually all Con's if you have any aspirations beyond an easy paycheck.";"KAYAK has long since ceased to be an innovative company.  Make no mistake, this is not the scrappy, innovative, boundary-pushing KAYAK of 10+ years ago.  If you've read the book ""A Truck Full of Money"" (about the company's founder and its early days), do not expect it to in any way resemble the company described in the book. Pretty much all of the company's original visionaries and A-players have long since left, and it is now a complete shadow of its former self.  

Today, KAYAK as an employer feels akin to a forever-busy, rich businessman dad who showers you with shiny gifts and money but never puts in the time or effort to actually be there for you.  Tech industry perks like free snacks, massages, happy hours, and ping pong abound.  But almost zero effort is put into helping employees build their skills, take on additional responsibility, or advance in their careers.  The leadership fundamentally does not care about anyone, despite their continual statements to the contrary.  This is probably because their revenue continues to climb year after year despite minimal improvements to the product, and numbers are all that really matter to them.

Indeed, from a technical perspective it seems KAYAK has basically been in ""maintenance mode"" for many years now. The service they provide is fundamentally a solved problem now and has been largely commoditized with dozens of other near-identical competing sites fighting for a share of the pie.  Engineering effort is primarily spent chasing and patching the absurd amount of bugs in its horrible code base rather than tackling new problems.  What little experimentation that does happen mostly just boils down to tweaking the UI and moving things around on the page to increase conversion and ad clicks.

Having no agenda for big technical endeavors, KAYAK has allowed its engineering organization to decay into a terrible state of dysfunction.  Talented people are leaving constantly, taking most of their knowledge with them (because hardly anything is documented), and they are being gradually replaced by less skilled engineers. 

Consequently, mediocrity and status quo reigns here now above all else.  New ideas, innovation, and creativity are not only NOT encouraged, but often actively suppressed.  It seems just about every idea put forth is met with some form of ""it just can't be done"" / ""that wouldn't work"" / ""that's not how we do it here"" / ""that's just the way it is"".  Sadly, most line managers really are genuinely nice people just trying to do their best, but basically have no license to do anything because of lack of support from upper management (most of whom don't understand software management).

Communication and collaboration between teams is almost non-existent, and when it does happen it usually goes very poorly.  The company mantra of ""No Stupid Meetings"" sounds great on paper, until you realize the result is that no one communicates with one another, managers have no idea what's going on and everyone is re-inventing the wheel every day because teams can't figure out how to collaborate or effectively share resources.

Ask yourself, is this the kind of environment you want to work in? When you could instead easily go to any number of other tech firms where people still want to try, to learn and improve, to push boundaries and change the world?

Yes, the facility itself isn't plush and yes, it is secure... but we do ship repair for the US Navy so security is necessary.  The nature of government contracts is that there will be an ebb and flow in the amount of work we have available.  As such, there will be layoffs when there is not enough work to justify keeping additional employees employed.  This is the case with any other company whose primary source of income is through government contracts.  I did not find management to be very well educated and qualified.  They were personable and made every effort to mentor the employees.  I also found the wages and reviews to be fair.  Good performers are definitely rewarded for their efforts.  One major bonus to working for MHI is that it is an ESOP.   As such, every employee is automatically awarded stock options with the company with no cost to the employee.

Only the language specialists care about quality, yet they are overworked, underpaid and blamed for all the mistakes. Management just wants everything done fast and cheap and basically forces the subtitlers do crazy hours, draining them before they decide to quit.

- If you're full time, the health benefits aren't bad. With what they offer, though, it's actually cheaper to just have Covered California/Healthnet/Obamacare if you're unmarried. If you do get health insurance, you have to be full time, of course...a lot of people are part-time but are expected to work full time hours, and they don't get health insurance, they don't get paid on holidays, etc.

- Some of the people you work with are cool.

- There are free bagels on Friday mornings.

- You can work an overnight shift, late hours or early hours if you like...the hours seem pretty flexible, if that appeals to you.";"- The work itself is mind-numbingly boring. Questions seem to be actively discouraged.

- You don't receive any proper training, and you're expected to know what's going on without anyone telling you.

- Insultingly low pay, 30 cent raises.

- People are overworked and overtime is expected at a moment's notice. You might be going home in an hour, and you suddenly get saddled with an overtime project. Expect to cancel dinners and be late to parties unless you are extremely proactive about complaining...even then, sometimes, there's nothing you can do about it.

- For the most part, other employees are extremely miserable and unfriendly. Most of the upper management looks away from you and doesn't even acknowledge your presence in the halls. Many people refuse to say hello back to you. Some departments are social and talk to each other, but for the most part, you'll see 90% of people in the breakroom eating lunch alone.

- Again, this point is worth making twice...if you're expecting *any* social interaction at your job, if you want to make friends at work, this is *not* the place to be. It's possible to make friends, but it takes serious work. Most of the staff is in a haze of boring work and general misery.

- Extremely depressing and dark atmosphere. No sun, no open windows, not even a single plant in the entire office...not even a fake plant.

- Much of what this company does will be phased out in 10 or 15 years. Google is already developing ways to automate a lot of this stuff...companies like SDI are trying to get everything they can out of it now before that happens. If you're thinking of this as a long-term place, you won't have a job in 10 years.

- Even if you *are* thinking of SDI as a long-term place, there is very little to no growth. The common trend is a ""side-motion"" instead of a promotion. You change departments and usually take a pay cut.

- Parking is awful, you have to park around the local neighborhood. There is street-sweeping on Wednesday and Friday mornings so most spots are quickly taken and you wind up needing to walk for pretty long distances.

- Bathrooms are absolutely disgusting and there is only *one* restroom on the entire property that SDI can use. There are always lines for the men's room. For the *men's room*. There is a petty and sad squabble between SDI and the NFL Network offices, which is also in the building...SDI can't use the NFL's cafe and the NFL staff can't use the SDI restroom.

Shifts are long; pool staff voice unwillingness to float to the facility and say it is because of heavy nurse/patient ration, not enough CNA's and perceive little support. This makes taking time off very difficult as well as adding support staff. A lot of nurses quit because of excessive floating. CNA's are hard to keep because they are overused; can potentially end up working on 2-3 units in a shift due to changes with patient numbers related to discharges and admissions and are usually not buddied up.

Important projects with fixed delivery dates are sometimes sat on until there isn't enough time left to do them right. The few members of management who do know what they're doing are so overworked that it can be hard to get what you need from them.

There's a lot of management by intimidation and temper tantrums going on. Some managers regularly yell at each other and their subordinates. Trying to use vacation time feels like asking a manager to give you a vital organ. There's constant pressure to work more and more hours. Management is still acting like the company is a start up who can only get business by delivering everything in one tenth the time of competitors. Management decisions are sometimes politically motivated with no regard for the merits of the choices.

There's a steady exodus of the most talented people.
